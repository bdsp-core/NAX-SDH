Chief Complaint:  Right pleural effusion s/p ***** drain

________________________________________________________________

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. ***** is a ***** year old female

***** cyclist struck by a motor vehicle on *****/*****.  She was

transported to ***** as a stat trauma, having sustained multiple

injuries (L acute EDH, grade III Liver laceration, right IIIa

open tib/fib fracture, closed R midshaft clavicle fx, ***** left

knee wound, right shoulder laceration, occipital laceration, and

L SDH), which have since been stabilized.  She was found

initially to have a liver laceration and mesenteric bleeding

requiring abdominal packing, and subsequent delayed closure. 

Post-operatively she complained of RUQ pain prompting additional

work-up.  Imaging demonstrated a perihepatic collection, and

percutaneous drain placement was performed on *****/*****.  Persistently

elevated LFTs prompted further investigation with ERCP,

sphincterotomy, and stent placement on *****/*****.



Ms. ***** became febrile and reported right chest pain and

shortness of breath prompting a CXR on *****/*****, which demonstrated a

new right pleural effusion.  Interventional pulmonology was able

to place a 12 French drain into the effusion, which initially put

out 1350cc, and approximately 600cc daily thereafter.  A repeat

chest CT on *****/***** showed a moderate right pleural effusion with

layering suggestive of loculation. Concern also arose for a

filling defect suggestive of segmental LLL ***** emboli.  A

heparin drip was started on *****/*****.  Meanwhile, her symptoms have

resolved, and she has not required supplemental oxygen.  Thoracic

surgery consultation was requested for possible VATS.

STUDIES:

Chest CT scan    Date: *****/*****/*****

Impression: (Prelim): Segmental pulmonary emboli in the left

lower lobe. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion with

*****. Liver laceration. Perihepatic drainage catheter in

situ.  



CXR               Date: *****/*****/*****

Findings:  Abdominal drainage catheter and right chest tube are

in stable position. There has been no significant change in the

right pleural effusion and right lower lobe atelectasis. There is

no evidence of pneumothorax. Heart size, vascularity, and left

lung are unchanged.  

IMPRESSION: No appreciable change. 



________________________________________________________________

IMPRESSION/PLAN:



Ms. ***** is a ***** year old female who presented to ***** as an

***** cyclist struck by a motor vehicle.  She has undergone

treatment and stabilization of multiple traumatic injuries, and

most recently has been evaluated for a persistent right pleural

effusion, s/p ***** ***** drain placement on *****/*****.  



Given the persistent drainage from the pleural catheter and

symptomatic improvement, and in light of the new requirement for

anticoagulation, no urgent thoracic surgical intervention is

currently recommended.  After discussion with the Interventional

Pulmonology team, they plan to re-adjust the position of the

existing drain and to place it to suction in order to increase

its utility in draining the effusion, which is felt to likely be

sympathetic in origin.  We will follow, monitor drain output and

repeat imaging, and discuss possible future surgical intervention

if necessary.



This consult was discussed with Dr. ***** *****, Thoracic fellow,

and Dr. *****, Attending ***** *****, who agree with the

above plan.

his head and face on *****. At *****, pt was intubated in order to

protect airway prior to transfer, as his blood alcohol was >330

and he was combative. CT revealed acute frontal ***** and left

sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhages. Neurosurgery was

consulted and declined surgical intervention. He was started on

500mg Keppra BID. Pt now extubated and c/o diplopia. 



Concerning the diplopia patient states that he has had a history

of diplopia which he attributes to an orbital fracture sustained

in 1995. He states that the diplopia is horizontal, constant but

worse on near gaze than far, and resolves with covering either

eye. He is unclear whether his current diplopia is any different

from his baseline. He denies any sensation or pressure or pain

behind his eye. He also reports a headache (which began during

interview) and neck pain.



On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred vision,

dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or

hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or

comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, *****. 

Denies difficulty with gait.



On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or

chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies

cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,

palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or

abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  No

dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The pt is a year-old ***** y/o man w/ history

of chronic polysubstance abuse who presents with diplopia in the

setting of head/facial trauma s/p bicycle accident. CT head shows

left frontal and ***** occipital subdural and frontal and

left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhages, in addition to

significant soft tissue swelling over right eye. Exam is

currently somewhat limited by patient cooperation and some

inconsistencies (initially diplopia was clearly binocular but was

also monocular during visual field testing). His diplopia may be

related to mild bilateral VI palsies, or could be related to

orbital or ocular trauma. It is currently unclear whether this is

actually different from his baseline diplopia. Currently we would

recommend the following:



-Repeat exam once more attentive to better characterize diplopia

-Ophthalmology consult to better evaluate for any contribution of

orbital/ocular trauma

-F/u CT sinus read to r/o new orbital fracture or other injury



We will continue to follow with you. Please do not hesitate to

contact us with any further questions.

BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:



HISTORY:

Thank you for referring this ***** year old female with PMHx of

recurrent falls with *****, mild-moderate dementia, CAD s/p

CABG 2012&#8203;, DM, MRSA osteomyelitis s/p R toe amputation

(*****/*****)&#8203;&#8203;, PVD s/p multiple stents and carotid

endarterectomy&#8203; admitted *****/*****/***** after an unwitnessed *****

at her nursing home that morning, found with R acute on chronic

subdural hematoma on head CT at *****. Per MD report, ***** due to

orthostatic hypotension vs. mechanical ***** in setting of

dementia, with toe amputation likely a contributing factor. Pt

without LOC on most recent *****; however, staff and daughter

noticed change in behavior and mental status after a few hours.

&#8203;Pt given Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and transferred

to ***** for neurosurgical evaluation. Pt admitted to the *****

where she received a unit of platelets; ICU stay complicated by

delirium, agitation, and orthostasis. Pt now transferred to

medicine service for management of delirium, IVF resuscitation

for orthostasis, and blood pressure. WBC counts are WNL. No CXR.

Most recent head CT *****/***** revealed stable large mixed-density

right hemispheric subdural hematoma and stable leftward shift of

midline structures; no new hemorrhage.&#8203; We have been

consulted to r/o aspiration when eating and drinking.



Pt has not been previously seen by our service. Pt is on a

regular diet. Per RN report, pt has been tolerating diet, with

pills crushed or whole in applesauce. Per pt's granddaughter, pt

on a regular diet at baseline. Pt denied hx of dysphagia.



EVALUATION:

The examination was performed while the patient was seated

upright in the bed on ***** 11. Pt's granddaughter was present at

the bedside.



Cognition, language, speech, voice: Pt was awake and alert.

Oriented to name ***** *****. Not oriented to date (""*****""

out of field of two, ""2013"" out of field of two). Pt's

granddaughter reported that pt is oriented x3 at baseline.

Expressive and receptive language were grossly intact. Speech was

intermittently unclear due to imprecise articulation and low

volume but grossly intelligible. Voice with mildly low volume but

WNL.

Teeth: Sparse natural dentition

Secretions: Clear oral mucosa



ORAL MOTOR EXAM:

Tongue protruded midline. Lingual, labial, and buccal strength

and ROM WNL. Palate elevated symmetrically. ***** deferred.



SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:

Pt offered PO trials of ice chips, thin liquids (tsp, cup),

pureed solids, ground solids, soft solids, and regular solids.

Oral phase was without anterior spillage or oral residue.

Mastication functional with rotary jaw movement despite sparse

natural dentition. Pharyngeal swallow triggered with palpable

laryngeal elevation. Pt was with light throat clearing after

initial ice chip. Pt was without other throat clearing, coughing,

wet vocal quality, or O2 desats after all other trials. Pt denied

sensation of aspiration or pharyngeal residue.



SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:

Ms. ***** presents without overt s/sx of aspiration after

large volume of thin liquids. Recommend pt continue diet of thin

liquids and regular solids, with pills crushed or whole in

applesauce. As pt's granddaughter reported that pt is not at

cognitive baseline, pt requires assistance with feeding and

set-up during meals and should have meals only when fully alert

and awake. Silent aspiration cannot be r/o without a

videoswallow. We will sign off. Please page for

questions/concerns.



This swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake

***** (FOIS) rating of *****/*****.



RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. PO diet: thin liquids, regular solids

2. Pills: crushed or whole in applesauce

3. BID oral care

4. Standard aspiration precautions, including:

- Assistance with feeding and meal set-up

- Only feed when fully awake and alert

5. We will sign off. Please page for questions/concerns.



These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and

medical team.

HOSPITAL MEDICINE INITIAL NOTE

Time patient seen and examined: 12:00 pm



I have seen, and examined the patient, reviewed the history,

physical exam, data, assessment and treatment plan as documented

by Dr. ***** dated yesterday, and today, and agree, except

for any additional comments below.

*****

***** have reviewed records of hospitalization.

***** yo woman with *****'s and dementia, here after second *****

resulting in injury in one month - on this occasion with left

radial fracture, and SDH.  She also had hospitalization in end of

***** with left greater trochanteric fracture. This also

followed a ***** two months ago with clavicular fracture.  She

lives alone in assisted living, with home services for much of

the day, but per family, often ambulates independently.  Prior to

these episodes she has not had *****, and has not lost

consciousness as far as she knows.  At present - she has no

specific complaints, although per resident note had dysuria. No

headache, areas of focal weakness or numbness.  PMH, FH, SH,

Medications, allergies noted in admission note, but not fully

confirmed without family available.  on exam - she is sitting in

chair, *****.  BP 88/52. O2 sat 84  rr 16  94% RA.  She is a

frail elderly woman.  She is oriented to person and hospital, and

remembers ***** ***** when I ask again.  Her face is symmetric,

tongue is midline.  lungs clear anteriorly.  CV regular without

murmurs appreciated. abdomen soft, NT, ND, NABS.  Ext with left

hand in splint.  No edema. Neuro alert, oriented to person and

date.  She has normal strength and sensation in feet, but is

somewhat stiff in right arm.



labs and imaging noted - with pyuria.  Imaging with fractures and

SDH noted.  EKG with sinus rhythm.



A/P  ***** yo woman with *****'s and dementia, here with *****

resulting in radial fracture and SDH.  She has had multiple

recent falls with injuries, and has poor safety awareness leading

to impulsive movements.  It does not appear that there is other

cause of her recurrent falls, although she may have a UTI, though

not clear that that caused these falls..  Safe discharge planning

will need to include her family to determine best options at this

point, given her poor experience previously with rehab, but the

clear lack of safety at home.



Frequent falls, with distal radius fracture, SDH, greater

trochanter fracture - agree with PT, pain control prn and *****

precautions.



Possible UTI - follow up cultures - and ctx reasonable.



Atrial fibrillation - by report - risk of anticoagulation with

old bleed, and *****, clearly ***** any benefit of

anticoagulation.



Dementia, possible acute delirium, *****'s - supportive care



Disposition - either today or tomorrow - will need to discuss

next steps with family and HCP - given clear failure with home

discharge, and need for either 24 hour care or rehabilitation. 

Her current lack of weight bearing with her left arm likely makes

a home discharge unlikely at this point.  Further discussion with

her PCP tomorrow may be helpful to clarify her baseline cognition

and functional status.



For prophylaxis - I agree with sc heparin if family in agreement,

given high rate of DVT with multiple fractures and immobility. 



We need to clarify code status.

ROS: A complete 13 point review of systems was performed and

significant findings were noted above.



EXAM: 

*****/*****/*****: Weight: 118.2

General: NAD

Nose: By anterior rhinoscopy there is no pus or polyps, mucosa is

pink and moist, septum is minimally deviated, turbinates are

minimally edematous

*****: mucous membranes are moist and pink, floor of mouth and

tongue are soft and non-tender to palpation, no trismus, no

mucosal lesions, salivary secretions are clear

Neck: trachea midline

Respiratory Effort: unlabored without stridor or stertor



PROCEDURE

In the context of the patient's clinical presentation and the

need to visualize the regions in close proximity, the decision

was made to proceed with an endoscopic exam. Accordingly, after

verbal consent and topical lidocaine with neosynephrine

anesthesia, the fiberoptic scope was passed to visualize the

regions of concern. The findings are reported below.



Nasal cavity:  Turbinate mucosa pink, moist; no drainage, pus or

polyps 

Nasopharynx:  Minimal residual adenoid tissue, no lesions or

masses, eustachian tube ***** patent, fossa of *****;

appears normal

Oropharynx:  Symmetric soft palatal elevation, no masses or

fullness in base of tongue

Hypopharynx:  No masses or lesions in vallecula, piriform

sinuses, or post-cricoid area; no erythema; no pooling of

secretions

Larynx:   Epiglottis non-edematous or erythematous. There is a

small shallow ulcer (~3mm) along the laryngeal surface of the

epiglottis likely secondary to prolonged intubation; ***** vocal

cords symmetric. There are submillimeter bilateral vocal fold

granulomas along the posterior aspect of the vocal folds. The

left vocal fold is slightly hypomobile but there is no glottis

gap appreciated; no mass lesions

cranioplasty w/ subsequent seizure d/o p/w 2 ***** in the setting

of acute on chronic traumatic LT SDH now extubated. ENT consulted

for airway evaluation. On exam, patient is not stridorous and is

breathing comfortably on room air. ***** shows bilateral

submillimeter vocal fold granulomas which do not obstruct the

airway, and are expected given recent intubation/extubation. The

left vocal fold is slightly hypomobile but there is no glottic

gap. The hypomobility is expected given recent prolonged

intubation. 



Recommend:

- Initiate PPI treatment, omeprazole 20mg PO BID

- humidified air or oxygen by shovel mask whenever possible to

aid with oral cavity dryness/irritation.

- Follow-up with Dr. ***** in clinic in 2-3 weeks after

discharge. Please call *****-*****-***** to make an appointment

with ""witnessed aspiration on night of *****/*****"". Per RN, pt was

observed to have coughing following a meal.

Alternative Nutrition: none

RN Report:



COGNITIVE-COMMUNICATION STATUS: Pt awake and alert and oriented

to self. Pt reported location of ""Massachusetts"" and year ""1969"".

Pt responded to all questions; however, with large volume of

tangential or irrelevant responses. Pt did verbalize some

awareness, such as when he asked if the nectar-thick liquids

could be less thick. Pt followed basic one- to two-step verbal

and visual commands. Speech with mildly imprecise articulation

but 100% intelligible with one repetition. Voice was WFL. 



ORAL *****:

Facial: symmetry observed

Labial: ROM WFL

Lingual: tongue protruded midline with reduced protrusion from

oral cavity. reduced ROM. 

Mandible: deferred

Palate: elevated symmetrically

*****: deferred

Dentition: upper dentures in place; no lower dentition

Secretions: clear oral mucosa

Cough Strength: weak cued and spontaneous cough



PO TRIALS:

Positioning: Pt seated upright in chair outside nursing station

on ***** 2.

Consistencies Trialed:

- ice chip

- thin liquids (tsp, cup)

- nectar-thick liquids (cup)

- pureed solids

- ground solids

- soft solids



SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:

     Oral Phase: Pt self-fed but appeared confused as to what to

do with the cup when placed in his hand. He required cues to open

his oral cavity when presented with the spoon. He was also very

easily distracted/impulsive and required cues to stay on task, to

take small bites, and to not speak with PO in oral cavity.

     Labial closure appeared intermittently incomplete; however,

no anterior loss noted. Mastication was with vertical *****

pattern and prolonged. Min oral residue noted, which cleared with

liquid wash. Suspected poor oral control with thin liquids. 



     Pharyngeal Phase: Hyolaryngeal elevation and excursion

appeared adequate to palpation. Pt with one swallow per bolus.

Immediate coughing noted x1 after thin liquid via tsp and x1

after thin liquid via cup. Pt with weak cued cough following

these events. Pt denied sensation of aspiration or pharyngeal

residue. 



     Esophageal Concerns: Pt with hx of GERD. No concerns noted

during evaluation.



SUMMARY/IMPRESSIONS:

Patient presents with suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia, most

remarkable for intermittent overt s/sx of penetration/aspiration

with thin liquids and with ineffective mastication of advanced

solids, in the setting of recent cognitive decline. Recommend

initiating a diet of nectar-thick liquids and ground solids, meds

crushed in applesauce. Pt requires supervision with meals, given

impulsivity and poor safety awareness with PO. Standard

aspiration precautions apply, with TID oral care. Recommend SLP

follow-up upon discharge to nursing facility. We will continue to

follow during this admission. Please page for questions/concerns

in the interim.



The patient's prognosis for return to ***** ***** good pending

improved mental status.



PLAN:

     Goals: 1. Patient will consume nectar-thick liquids and

ground solids without overt s/sx of aspiration. 

            2. Patient will tolerate trials of thin liquids WITH

SLP ONLY without overt s/sx of aspiration. 

     Treatment Frequency: ongoing during inpatient admission)



EDUCATION:

     Provided to: ***** ***** (pt's HCP)

     Content: completion of evaluation, rationale for diet change

and SLP services

     Mode: telephone call

     Understanding: verbally demonstrated understanding



This swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake

***** (FOIS) rating of *****/*****.



RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Diet: nectar-thick liquids and ground solids

2. Medications: crushed in applesauce

3. Standard aspiration precautions, including:

- Supervision with meals

- Cues to slow rate of intake

- Cues to not speak with PO in oral cavity

- Only feed when awake and alert

4. TID oral care

5. SLP follow-up upon discharge to nursing facility

6. We will continue to follow. Please page for

questions/concerns. 



These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and

medical team.

ASSESSMENT/RECOMMENDATIONS: 



51 female with a nondisplaced sacral fracture.  This is a closed

injury that will not require surgical fixation.  Patient's

neurologic exam is currently limited by her altered mental

status.  However, the appearance of the lesion on CT does not

raise concern for neurologic injury.  She has intact rectal tone

and is moving her bilateral lower extremities.  Would concur with

admission, likely to trauma surgery, for management of her

multiple traumatic injuries.  No acute surgical interventions

indicated for the sacral fracture.  She may be weightbearing as

tolerated.

Reason for consult:

Seizure



HPI:

Ms. ***** is a ***** year old right handed woman with history of

seizure disorder managed off AEDs by ***** ***** and

Rheumatoid Arthritis on Methotrexate who presents to the ***** *****

as a transfer from ***** ***** where she was found to have a

sub-acute/chronic subdural hematoma on CT scan.  The patient

noted being in her usual state of health last evening without any

recent illness or trauma.  This morning, around *****, the

patient reported sudden onset frontal headache over the eyes and

forehead which was tension type, with nausea, non-vertiginous

lightheadedness, and vomiting.  She noted such severe

incapacitation from these symptoms that she requested the air

conditioning mechanic visiting her home contact *****.  She was

transported to ***** ***** ***** where she was witnessed to have

convulsive activity concerning for seizure (not specified if

unilateral or generalized) with subsequent confusion and aphasia.

NCHCT performed demonstrated a left parietal subdural hematoma

which was subacute to chronic in evolution.  She was transported

to ***** ***** for neurosurgical evaluation and potential evacuation

of the bleed.  She was also given Ativan and loaded with

Fosphenytoin.  



In the ***** *****, she was noted to have right sided hemibody

weakness, neglect of the right side, and marked global aphasia. 

After 3-4 hours many of these symptoms gradually had resolved

with only subtle deficits.



Per the patient's report, there has been no recent history in the

past months of any accident, trauma, *****, vigorous

activity, or other precipitant factors for her left parietal

subdural hematoma.

 

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred vision,

diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,

tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or

comprehending speech.  Denies current focal weakness although

before the patient endorsed profound right weakness.  Denies

numbness, *****. No bowel or bladder incontinence or

retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or

chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies

cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,

Summary:

***** RHW h/o simple partial seizures off AEDs p/w new sub-acute

to chronic left parietal subdural hematoma with new convulsive

seizure activity with loss of consciousness and resolving

weakness/confusion likely post-ictal phenomena including *****'s

paralysis.  On examination, the patient has some inattention and

difficulty with ordering, however, her reported global aphasia

has improved significantly to the point where she has no

difficulty naming high or low frequency items.  Her reported

weakness in the right arm has resolved completely with no

distribution demonstrating anything but full strength.  Given her

reported symptoms, it is highly likely that the patient

experienced a provoked seizure due to left cortical irritation

resulting in likely complex partial focal motor convulsions in

the right hemibody which may have secondarily generalized.  Her

confusion and right hemibody weakness which resolved over the

next hours are likely post-ictal phenomena rather than any

evidence of transient ischemia, or further seizure activity.  It

is unclear though why she bled intracranially; possible

etiologies include previous trauma, falls, strenuous activity

(although the patient denies all of these), or possibly amyloid,

aneurysmal disease, or AVM.  We will admit and evaluate with

imaging and EEG.

Addendum by ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** at 1:10 pm:

Pt seen and examined. Spoke with pt and daughter. Agree with

details and plan as outlined above.



***** year old female followed by Dr. ***** for remote history fo

seizures, last sz over 5 years ago and characterized by a feeling

of alternate reality, not on seizure meds. She relates that she

his her head approximately two weeks ago on the left. No

headache, a mild bruise. Yesterday developed sudden onset

dizziness, had to sit down and then had ***** speech, right arm

numbness, almost feeling of ***** hand. Also noted difficulty

seeing to the right for a period of time. Had second two minute

episode that daughter described as mouth twitching, followed by

confusion. Pt does not recall events. Was seen at *****, *****

showed small left parietal subdural ***** which was subacute

to chronic. Question of seizure raised -> dilantin.



Pt transferred to *****. Seen by neurosurgery Dr. ***** - no

intervention, additional workup recommended. 



On exam, pt is back to baseline. She did complain of some events

of feeling that her right arm was in an odd position- when it

really was not. Has not had any spells since this morning. Denies

any side effects to the dilantin.



Exam AA oriented times three. ***** backwards. speech fluent, no

paraphasic errors. notable for some left/right confusion. no

EDSS. no neglect. no field cut. recalls only *****/***** items.

eomi no nystagmus, symmetric, sensation intact, audition intact,

tongue midline, pal elevates, scm/trap intact. pupils *****. no

drift, no asterixis. good strength. sensation intact to

vibration/pp/lt. may be trace vib loss in toes. reflexes

symmetric. toes down. has a little difficulty on fnf on the

right. gait deferred.



mri shows small left parietal subdural and cerebral amyloid

angiopathy.



Impression: presumptive focal seizure in setting of left

subdural. 



***** the sdh, dr. ***** does not feel that any additional eval/

workup needed and no need for intervention. will need followup

with neurosurgery to ensure resorption/ improvement of sdh.



***** seizure, pt loaded on  dilantin. longer term will benefit

from transition to keppra. pt with old history of depression

which seems fairly well controlled. will obtain EEG to eval for

interictal activity.

Our physicians and technologists are dedicated to providing highly skilled and compassionate care for you and your family. We understand that you may be apprehensive about your procedure. We hope that you will find the following information helpful as you prepare for the exam.  What should I expect BEFORE my CT scan? ***** When to arrive: You need to arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment. ***** Medications: It is important for you to keep your regular medication schedule. Please take all the medications that have been prescribed to you by your doctor and bring a list to your CT appointment. ***** Diabetic conditions: If you are an insulin-dependent diabetic, please continue to take your insulin as prescribed, but remember to drink extra fruit juices to make up for the fasting of solid foods for the 2 period that your 
stomach is empty. Patients who are taking diabetic medications should take the prescribed dose as normally done on that day. Patients should notify their Primary Care Physician (PCP) that they had contrast and were instructed to discontinue their medication for 48 hours. If you need a substitute medication, please consult your doctor. ***** Food and drink: You should not eat solid foods for two hours prior to your test. You may, however, drink plenty of fluids, such as water, broth, clear soups, juice, or black ***** coffee or tea. We encourage you to drink plenty of fluids before your arrival to our facility. ***** What to wear: You should dress in comfortable clothing. It might be necessary for you to change into a hospital gown if there is metal in your clothing, such as a ***** or *****, within the area of interest of your study. If you are wearing jewelry or anything else that might interfere with your scan, we will ask you to remove it. It is best that you leave your valuable items at home. ***** Intravenous preparation: Many patients receive a contrast agent intravenously (IV) during their CT test. If your doctor or the radiologist has determined that this procedure will enhance your CT scan results, the technologist will place an IV in your arm or hand prior to going into the exam.  During the Scan: You will meet the CT technologist when you are taken into the exam room. The technologist will explain everything that is happening. You will be helped onto the table, positioned correctly and may be secured by a strap which helps prevent you from moving. ***** slight movement blurs the x-rays.  The CT technologist controls the procedure in another room where they can still see and hear you. You will be moved slightly after each scan, although you may not notice the change. When the CT scan is complete, the technologist will make sure he or she has all the information the doctor will need. Your time in the CT scan room 
will vary between 10 and 20 minutes per test depending on the procedure.  After your Scan: Once the technologist has all the images the physician requires, they will assist you off of the table. You are discharged immediately and you may resume your normal diet. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids for several days unless otherwise contraindicated. If you become constipated make sure you speak to the physician that ordered the test.  Contrast reactions happen rarely after leaving the hospital. However if you develop a skin rash, difficulty breathing or severe nausea or vomiting please contact your physician. If your symptoms are severe, call 911 or go to the closest emergency room.  The technologist cannot discuss results with you. The CT scan will be reviewed by a Radiologist and the results will be sent to the doctor who ordered your exam.

This was also in the setting of thrombocytopenia. He was placed on LTM for c/f seizure which was reassuring, was transitioned onto Keppra monotherapy 1.5g BID from ***** (for c/f thrombocytopenia)     He was discharged to ***** Bay on *****/*****. OT eval prior to discharge on *****/***** noted ""cognitive deficits including impaired orientation, attention, memory, and sequencing. He continues to require assistance with all self-care and mobility tasks due to impaired balance, strength, and activity tolerance"". However, he had improved participation in the OT session, and was able to sustain arousal throughout. Could follow simple 1 step commands.      Per collateral obtained from the ED providers, it seems that the family was concerned about pt being less interactive today, and unable to participate in *****/OT. No falls since being at ***** *****. No frank tonic clonic activity.      ED course:      Vitals: afebrile. HR: occasionally tachy to 110, would then resolve to 70s-90s. *****-150s/90s-104. RR 18-20. Sats high 90s on RA.     BMP wnl, Glu 148, LFTs with new mild hepatocellular injury pattern /w ALT/AST elevated to 62|53 (ammonia 22), CBC wnl /w PLT resolved to 243 after stopping VPA, coags /w INR 1.3 (baseline).  UA <10 WBC and rapid resp panel /w COVID-19 negative.     CT head: Expected evolution of multi-compartmental intracranial hemorrhage; no evident new or expanding hemorrhage. Redistribution/resorption of intraventricular hemorrhage; no evidence for progressive hydrocephalus.     Exam in the ED: old 
ecchymoses noted. He was conversant. Intermittently oriented to person, place. No focal weakness noted on exam. Was trying to get out of bed frequently. Received ***** 5 mg x 1, and seroquel 25 mg (per prior d/c med list). Had also received keppra 2000 mg IV x 1 ~1600, and 1500 mg at 2100.     =========================  Hospital course (by problem):  =========================  #Altered mental status  Pt has a very complex neuro history including right chronic SDH s/p craniotomy for SDH evacuation (Dr. *****, *****/*****/*****) c/b epilepsy with right-sided status epilepticus and breakthrough seizures (managed on keppra, previously also on valproic acid though this was discontinued iso thrombocytopenia on most recent admission) s/p re-evacuation of SDH on *****/*****/*****, with recent admission to ***** (*****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****) for traumatic 10mm R tentorial SDH, 5mm LF IPH, and scattered sulcal SAH. Now presenting from ***** with AMS. Per report, pt seemed less interactive, conversant, and less able to follow commands. On arrival, pt afebrile, ***** with sats in 90s on RA. BMP unremarkable. TSH WNL. Ammonia wnl. UA 1+ blood though otherwise negative. Urine culture preliminary results with rare (100 to <*****/ml) Staph. CXR with hazy opacities in lung bases, though CT chest was without evidence of pneumonia. COVID-19 NP PCR negative. Low suspicion for meningitis given no meningismus. Has had urinary incontinence which suggests against urinary retention. Creatine WNL. CT head showed natural progression of pt's past intracranial hemorrhage, though no evidence of any acute changes. Repeat CT head (*****/*****) was stable and without interval change when compared to initial CT head collected on *****/*****. EEG (*****/*****) with abundant to near continuous focal delta>theta slowing, and no epileptiform abnormalities presents which when compared with his EEG on (*****/*****) showed no new significant changes. No leukocytosis. ***** was consulted, and recommended 
Neurology consult. Neurology was reassured by stable physical exam and head imaging and signed off with recommendation to continue keppra 1500mg BID. ***** recommended non-urgent MRI, though this was deferred given stable repeat CT head without new neurological changes. Given reassuring work-up, overall poor substrate, and recent discharge to unfamiliar environment the most likely etiology of his AMS is  hypoactive delirium. Further supporting hypoactive delirium is the waxing and waning mental status changes observed during his admission. On the day of discharge, the patient was largely alert, following commands, pleasant, and conversational. No new focal neurological deficits. In discussion with his daughter, his orientation has been persistently limited to self for several weeks prior to this admission. Recommended familiarity as much as possible -- having familiar objects and pictures at his bedside, calling, and visiting him as often as able. Pt will continue to work with PT and OT and should continue to follow-up routinely with ***** outpatient. A referral to Neuro-palliative was placed at discharge for optimized advance care planning. He was continued on his home keppra, seroquel, aricept, and melatonin at discharge.     #Seizures  Pt with hx of subdural hematoma s/p craniotomy whose course was complicated by epilepsy with status epilepticus and breakthrough seizures for which he is on home Keppra. EEG this admission with no significant changes from prior one week prior. Per neurology, pt's Keppra is unlikely to be contributing to his principal presenting problem. Keppra level was pending at the time of discharge and he was continued on his home keppra dose of 1500mg BID per Neurology recommendations. Keppra level was pending at the time of discharge.     #Dysphagia  Pt has hx of dysphagia in setting of TBI s/p fall from ladder in 2020. He presents this admission for concerns of AMS. CXR with hazy opacities in 
bilateral lung bases which could reflect aspiration vs developing pneumonia. On arrival, patient was placed on dysphagia diet with pureed food and mildly thick liquids. SLP was consulted to evaluate patient for advancement of diet as appropriate, and ultimately recommended soft/bite sized with thin liquids and felt his evaluation was unchanged from recent evaluation on prior hospitalizations. *****, ***** chest did not show evidence of any pneumonia.     #Hyperlipidemia  Atorvastatin that was initially held in the setting of elevated transaminases which has since resolved. Atorvastatin was restarted with normalization of LFTs.      #Transaminitis  Pt initially presented for AMS found to have mildly elevated transaminases (ALT 62, AST 53, ***** 115) on arrival. Pt's home Atorvastatin was held, and hepatitis serologies were ordered in this setting though unremarkable. Subsequent LFTs showed downtrending ALT 47, AST 32, ***** 70. Atorvastatin was restarted and RUQUS cancelled.      #Hypertension  Continued lopressor 12.5mg BID.       Medications   Allergies: Patient has no known allergies.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    =========================  While you were in the hospital:  =========================  You came to the Emergency Department because your family was concerned that you had a change in mental status.    While you were at the hospital, you did not know where you were, or what month/year it was so we did the following:    - You had some blood drawn for a broad laboratory workup. These came back normal aside from you liver function labs, which were slightly elevated. *****, these returned back to normal without intervention.     - You had a CT scan of your head, where they did not find any new bleeding or swelling in or around your brain. You were evaluated by both Neurology and Neuro-Surgery who recommended continuation of your medications. They were reassured by your stable imaging and your negative infectious work-up.    - You were confused while admitted and became a bit aggressive with the staff, so we had you in soft wrist restraints for your safety and the staff's. This improved and your restraints were 
removed.     - We think your altered mental status is attributable to ""delerium."" This is confusion that waxes and wanes. You may seem tired and confused sometimes, but alert and more oriented at other times. You are at high risk of delirium because of your extensive neurological history, your recent hospitalizations, and your unfamiliar environment at the rehab facility. We recommend that you surround yourself with familiarity, and we spoke with your daughter ***** about getting familiar objects to put at your bedside, and printing out pictures for you to look at.     =====================================  When you leave the hospital, we recommend:  =====================================  - Please follow up with your primary care provider and any specialists who you see for ongoing outpatient care. Your scheduled appointments are included in this discharge paperwork. It is very important that you go to any scheduled appointments. If, for any reason, you cannot make it to your appointments please call that office to let them know so they can reschedule you appropriately.    - It is very important that you carefully review your ***** medication list, paying special attention to new medications and medications you have been instructed to stop. Take all your medications as they are prescribed to you.     - A healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is a great way to support overall health.

Spoke to HCP ***** and elected for palliative measures so consulting home hospice.     =================================  Admission HPI (per admitting provider):  =================================  This is a ***** with advanced alzheimers dementia, seizure disorder, prior ***** with subdural hemorrhage s/p 
evacuation (2020), recent admission (discharged *****/*****) for hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids with course complicated by urinary retention requiring foley who presents with altered mental status.      Patient has moderately severe dementia requiring 24/7 care. He was recently admitted to ***** for hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids with course complicated by urinary retention thought secondary to BPH for which a foley was placed with plan for outpatient urology follow-up. Per VNA at beside, prior to this admission patient was able to ambulate and have a conversation. After discharge on *****/*****, however, he did not fully return to ***** ***** baseline. He spent most of the day in a chair or in bed, and was less talkative. Given this change in mental status, his primary care doctor ordered a UA which was inflammatory with pyuria, concerning for UTI for which he was prescribed a course of ciprofloxacin starting *****/*****; culture grew MSSA and pan-susceptible E. Coli. Despite antibiotics, his mental status worsened and symptoms progressed such that he stopped eating so EMS was called. Of note, patient suffered ***** out of bed on *****/*****/*****. He has also been complaining of left leg pain for past several weeks with recent x-ray of femur showing mixed sclerotic and lucent changes (favored to be infarct and less likely *****'s disease) as well as swelling thought secondary to venous insufficieny (negative ***** *****/*****/*****, normal biventricular function on TTE *****/*****/*****).           ED Course:    On presentation to ED, vitals notable for tachycardia to 115 and hypoxemia requiring 4L via nasal cannula. Initial labs notable for leukocytosis to 13 and PT-INR 1.6. CT head showed 3 mm left frontoparietal subdural hematoma. CT-PE chest revealed RUL pulmonary embolism, new RLL dense consolidation and acute fracture of right clavicle and left eight rib. CT abdomen/pelvis revealed no acute findings with unchanged severe L1 compression 
fracture. ***** was consulted and recommended holding anticoagulation given high risk of re-bleeding. He also received on dose of IV vitamin *****. ***** team was in agreement with holding anticoagulation. Trauma was consulted for fractures. He was started on cefepime/***** with notable fever to 101.8 this AM. Blood cultures drawn on presentation are NGTD, UA was inflammatory with pyuria (20-50).                 =========================  Hospital course (by problem):  =========================    #Goals of Care Discussion  The patient has had a long medical course as described below with admission in beginning of ***** and he has not returned to his baseline after that admission. He has now returned for SDH, multiple fractures, PE and DVT. The patient has become weaker and AMS worsening with more sedation and loss of appetite. Spoke to HCP ***** who voiced the same concern that patient has not returned to his baseline in early ***** after the first admission. He was concerned that the patient has loss his will to eat and is refusing medications. He knows the patient well for over 40 years and knows that he would not want any surgeries or heroic measures to be taken. He knows that the patient would want to pass away at home and would be more comfortable at home. He elected to consult palliative care and home hospice. The home hospice team has been in discussions with him regarding dropping off supplies at his house and plan for discharge home. Discussed stopping unnecessary medications and PO medications because he is refusing to take medications. AED medications are oral and patient will not be able to take so home hospice team recommended using Rectal Diazepam PRN and SL Lorazepam 1mg Q6hours. ***** placed *****/***** and will stay in indefinitely for comfort. Stopping Tamsulosin. Tylenol PR, Lidocaine patches, and Voltaren Gel for pain control. Home hospice team can add oral morphine if patient appears to be in pain but 
currently he does not appear in pain. ***** completed a ***** form over the phone and signed by witness.     #Altered mental status  At baseline, the patient reportedly able to ambulate, have a conversation, and feed himself. Never returned to prior baseline after most recent hospitalization (discharged *****/*****/*****) -- immobile, and less engaged. In the days PTA, he developed worsening altered mental status and was obtunded on presentation. Likely multifactorial etiology including toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infections, electrolyte derangement, and possibly from small SDH, all superimposed on poor substrate given severe underlying dementia. There was low concern for breakthrough seizure based on exam and lactate WNL. Unlikely meningitis given reassuring exam without meningismus. Mental status initially improved with treatment of infection but then it worsened and patient stopped eating and drinking. He refused PO medications. GOC discussion as above and elected for referral for home hospice.       #Aspiration pneumonia  WBC 13.9k on ***** ***** *****-PE showing dense consolidation in ***** and multifocal nodular opacities concerning for aspiration pneumonia. Suspect recurrent aspiration event as his WBC rose substantially to 38.3k within 12 hours and he had increased oxygen requirement to 3L NC. He was started empirically on vanc/zosyn (*****/***** - *****/*****), unable to produce a sputum given AMS. MRSA swab negative, transitioned to CTX/flagyl (*****/***** - *****/*****), though Flagyl was discontinued on *****/*****. His HH aide observed increased difficulty swallowing at home. SLP recommended pureed diet with mildly thick liquids with meds crushed in puree and 1:1 supervision with feeds. Diet was kept palliative at discharge. He can eat puree and mild thick liquids but eating is for comfort and enjoyment.       #Urinary tract infection  #***** catheter in place  Developed urinary retention during his most recent hospitalization, thought 
secondary to immobility, and was discharged with a ***** in place on *****/***** with a plan for outpatient follow-up with Urology. Given ongoing confusion, a UA was sent outpatient and urine culture grew abundant MSSA and Ecoli, for which he was prescribed a course of cipro starting *****/*****. UA this admission remained c/w infection, and repeat urine culture grew few MSSA. CT abdomen/pelvis without concern for pyelonephritis. ***** exchanged *****/*****/*****. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics given concern for septic infection, likely from aspiration pneumonia, and therefore cipro was discontinued. He received adequate treatment for UTI with Vanc/zosyn (*****/*****-*****/*****) followed by CTX (*****/***** - *****/*****). He was started on Flomax on *****/*****, foley was exchanged on *****/***** secondary to *****, and then he underwent a void trial on *****/***** which was unsuccessful and he needed foley replaced on *****/*****. He only produced 415cc of urine in the 24 hour period and was unable to void it. This demonstrated how dehydrated he had been from not eating or drinking.      #Subdural hematoma  Incidentally found to have new SDH (3 mm) on CT head likely from recent ***** at home. Repeat CT done for stability 6 hours later with stable SDH (4 mm). ***** consulted, recommended repeat CTH in 1 week, which showed no interval increase in ***** and no new intracranial bleeds. Thorough discussion was had with *****, *****, about risks and benefits of leaving IVC filter in place vs starting on oral anticoagulation. Because ***** is such a high bleed risk, his HCP opted to leave IVC filter in place indefinitely, understanding the risks associated with doing so.    #VTE (venous thromboembolism)  #Pulmonary embolism  #Multiple deep vein thromboses  Decreased mobility since at least *****/*****/***** due to severe left leg pain, then essentially bed-bound since recent discharge on *****/*****/*****. On admission he was tachycardic and hypoxic, with CT PE (*****/*****) showing PE in ***** 
pulmonary artery. ***** flat. No RV strain on CT. Given small SDH, ***** team recommended against initiation of AC particularly given risk of re-bleeding and concomitant coagulopathy with INR 1.6. They recommended repeat CTH in 1 week, which showed no interval increase in ***** and no new intracranial bleeds Given his history of large SDH requiring evacuation, recent ***** *****/***** hemorrhoids, diverticular bleed (2020), and high risk of falls the decision was made to defer anticoagulation after thorough discussion of risks/benefits with HCP. The ***** team was consulted and recommended *****, which showed multiple DVTs (RLE: popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal; LLE: peroneal). IVC filter placed *****/*****, with recommendation to remove as soon as AC can be safely initiated, though also noted it could be left in indefinitely though with some associated risks.      #Fractures  Found to have acute clavicular fracture, left eighth rib fracture, and severe L1 compression fracture with reported fall from standing on *****/*****/*****. Ortho Trauma and Trauma Surgery consulted in ED with recommendation for conservative management including sling for comfort, multimodal pain regimen, and incentive spirometry. Previously prescribed alendronate for several years, most recent DEXA (*****/*****) showing osteopenia. Fracture ***** consulted who recommended cholecalciferol 2000 IU QD, calcium carbonate 500mg elemental calcium BID, and zoledronic acid 5mg IV x1 (*****/*****). Recommend follow-up with Endocrine Associates or with Rheumatology for continued bone health if his goals of care change.      #Left leg pain  Patient with debilitating left leg pain and swelling starting ~*****/*****, significantly limiting mobility, was being worked-up by his PCP prior to admission. Outpatient work-up included TTE (*****/*****) with LVEF 71% and normal biventricular function. ***** (*****/*****) negative for DVT. Left hip and femur XR without fracture or other acute change compared to 
2020 films. This admission, L knee XR shows chondrocalcinosis. Rheum consulted, s/p L knee arthrocentesis (*****/*****) which did now show evidence of crystals and given the fact patient was largely bed bound a corticosteroid injection was deferred. Suspect multiple new DVTs in his left leg are also contributing. Pain managed adequately. PT recommended inpatient rehab.    #Dementia  Alzheimer's dementia requiring 24/7 care though, per VNA at bedside, patient is able to ambulate and have a conversation at baseline. Oriented to self only. Given AMS, he was initially unable to take home medications for dementia. Continued home donepezil and memantine until the patient started not eating and refusing medications. At this time, Donepezil and Namenda will not be helpful because of end-stage Dementia.       #Seizure disorder  Seizure disorder, chronically on phenobarbital 21.4 mg TID and phenytoin 100 mg QID. Given AMS, patient not able to tolerate PO meds, so AED transitioned to IV phenobarbital 32.4mg TID, and IV fosphenytoin 100mg until mental status improved and orals could be reinitiated. Phenytoin level 19.2 on *****/*****. The patient was not taking PO medications upon discharge so he was convert to Ativan SL liquid 1mg Q6 hours and Rectal Diazepam 15mg PRN for active seizure.        #Abnormal LFTs  CT A&P without explanation for elevated LFTs. Abd US without hepatic lesions or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. Mild prominence of CBD, though likely post-***** related. Suspect ***** vs shock liver from hypotension in the ED. LFTs improved and returned to WNL without intervention.    #AKI  Baseline 0.6-0.7, peaked at ~1.5, suspect ATN iso sepsis. Cr on discharge 0.45. The patient continued to be dehydrated from not eating and drinking so labs were stopped for palliative care.      #Diarrhea  Loose stool noted on presentation to ED. Cdiff negative. Stool culture negative for enteric pathogens, +mod yeast. ***** negative. CT AP 
with extensive sigmoid diverticulosis which could be contributing, atop of recent decreased nutritional intake and IV antibiotics/underlying infection. ***** abdominal exam was benign, without pain, rebound tenderness, or distention and loose stools resolved.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    =========================  While you were in the hospital:  =========================  - You came to the hospital for altered mental status. You were found to have a urinary tract infection and an aspiration pneumonia. You were treated with IV antibiotics for your infection.    - You were found to have a small collection of blood in your subdural space in your head. You were evaluated by the Neurosurgery Team who recommended surveillance CT scans to monitor this bleed. These scans showed no interval increase in the size of the bleed and no new bleeds.     - You were also found to have a blood clot in your lungs (called a pulmonary embolism). The standard treatment for blood clots is a 
blood thinner, but due to the bleeding in your head and your history of GI bleeds and chronic bleeding in your head you were not considered to be a safe candidate for a blood thinner. Our Vascular Medicine Team evaluated you and recommended ultrasounds of your legs to look for deep vein clots. You were found to have several clots in the deep veins of your legs (where clots are most likely to form). You had a filter placed in one of the large veins that leads to your heart to catch any of the clots that might break up and try to travel to ***** *****. It was elected to keep the IVC filter in place indefinitely rather than starting blood thinning medications because you have a high risk of bleeding on blood thinners.      - You had several fractures noted on your imaging including of your collar bone, your ribs, and of one of your vertebrae. The Fracture ***** service evaluated you and recommended supplemental vitamin D and an IV medication to help your bones get stronger in the hope that this will prevent future fractures.    - Due to your altered mental status, you were initially unable to take oral medications safely. Your seizure medications were changed to IV formulation. You were not taking oral pills well so your seizure medication was changed to Ativan 1mg liquid to be given Sub-lingual every 6 hours. The home hospice team will fill prescription for Valium to be given in case of a seizure as rectal suppository.      - You were discharged with a ***** on your most recent admission. This admission your ***** was removed but you were unable to urinate so it was replaced.     - You were evaluated by the Speech and ***** Team who recommended a modified diet to prevent aspiration: pureed solids and mildly thick liquids.    - Your long hospital stay and previous hospital stay took a large toll on your mental status and you stopped eating or drinking and you were refusing medications. After discussion with your 
health care proxy *****, it was determined that you would not have wanted heroic measures to be taken and instead would have elected for palliative care. Your unnecessary medications were discontinued and other medications converted to rectal or sublingual formulations so you can still receive them for palliative measures. Home Hospice consulted and you were set up with home services to make you comfortable at home.    =====================================  When you leave the hospital, we recommend:  =====================================  - Please follow up with Home Hospice for ongoing care and home services. The goal of your care now is to keep you comfortable and keep you at home.      - It is very important that you carefully review your ***** medication list, paying special attention to new medications and medications you have been instructed to stop. Take all your medications as they are prescribed to you.

One week later the patient reported weight gain of 7 lbs, and increased leg swelling, so furosemide was switched back to torsemide.  As a result, it is most likely that the lower extremity edema is in the setting of acute exacerbation of HFpEF.  Oncology was consulted and it's unlikely that gemcitabine at 1 infusion cycle to be the etiology of his lower extremity edema. Received ***** ***** 25 g for IV repletion and lasix 40 mg BID for extravascular depletion.

Renally adjusted dose of Eliquis half dose, discharged on home dose after the renal function improved.    #Acute urinary retention  Urology was consulted and recommended ***** catheter being in place for 7 days and then follow up in the clinic in 7 days for voiding trial. Flomax discontinued because of orthostatic hypotension.      #Normocytic anemia   Based on oncology consult, most likely due to bone marrow suppression in the setting of chemotherapy with gemcitabine, hemoglobin 10 -> 8.5 -> 8, also checked vit B12, and folate, which were normal.      #Atrial fibrillation  Digoxin level above threshold for toxicity, though this is probably in the setting of suspected hemoconcentration.

Reason for Consultation: aphasia  



HPI:  

***** ***** is a ***** year old man with a history of aflutter (not

currently anticoagulated) who presents with an acute onset

aphasia.  



He was discharged home from the ***** Neurosurgery service

earlier today (*****/*****) after a subdural hematoma (SDH) evacuation.

This morning he was doing well; he was able to follow the tennis

match on the TV and explain recent events surrounding the game.

At 4pm he had sudden difficulty speaking. He was aware of his

speech problem and was frustrated. He took a nap and woke up

around 9pm at which time his speech had worsened. He was

evaluated by a caretaker who also noted a right pronator drift

and said his right hand was ***** with increased tone. He was

taken to the ED where a code stroke was called. NIHSS was 6 for

language right sided sensory deficits (although this was

unreliable *****/***** the aphasia). NCHCT was stable from his recent

post op head CT. Stat brain MRI ruled out acute stroke. He was

evaluated by both neurology and neurosurgery. He was admitted to

the neurosurgery ICU for close monitoring overnight and further

workup of his language problems. 

 

He initially presented after a ***** and was admitted to the

trauma service for neck pain with T11 and T12 disc space widening

and C7 osteophyte fracture on imaging. During his hospitalization

on *****/*****, a code stroke was called when nursing staff noted him

***** words and speaking gibberish. Upon neurologic

evaluation, is speech was fluent but with multiple paraphasic

errors and impaired repetition, comprehension, and naming. On

head CT he was found to have a SDH and is now s/p left craniotomy

and SDH evacuation. He was started on keppra for seizure

prophylaxis. He had a later episode of similar speech

abnormalities that resolved as well. His keppra dose was

increased to 750mg BID. EEG was obtained which showed slowing and

breech artifact but no epileptic discharges. He was discharged

home earlier today *****/*****/*****.

evidence of an acute large territorial infarction.  



MRI/MRA *****/*****/*****:  

No acute stroke. The patient is status post left craniotomy.

Areas of bright signal on the TRACE images in the left parietal

hardware and skin staples. Bilateral extra-axial fluid

collections are stable compared to the prior CT head of ***** *****.

***** ***** ***** ***** 23:01.  



EEG *****/*****/*****:  

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU EEG study due to intermittent

focal delta slowing over the left hemisphere, as well as increase

voltages over the left hemisphere consistent with *****

artifact. These findings are indicative of a focal structural

lesion and skull defect in the left hemisphere, maximal in the

posterior quadrant. Background activity over the right hemisphere

is low voltage and mildly slow, indicating additional more

diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific as to

etiology.  



CXR *****/*****/*****:   Preliminary Report

No new opacity to indicate infection or aspiration. 





ASSESSMENT and PLAN:  

***** ***** is a ***** year old man with a history of afib (not

currently anticoagulated) and a recent hospitalization s/p *****

with a SDH (s/p evacuation) who re-presents to the hospital with

symptoms of aphasia. On exam he has a severe *****'s aphasia and

mild right hand weakness. Head CT was stable. Stat MRI in the ED

ruled out acute stroke. The DDx includes seizures, particularly

in the setting of recent SDH near the language area. He should

have an EEG done as soon as possible to assess for seizures. He

did have two similar episodes of aphasia during his

hospitalization (although by documentation do not appear to have

been as severe as this episode) and workup at that time with

repeat ***** ***** and EEG was unrevealing. If EEG rules out

seizures, this could be local cortical irritability in the

setting of the recent SDH. 

- please obtain EEG (bedside continuous video)

- continue keppra

RE:  ***** ***** (***** *****-*****-*****) DOB:  *****/*****/*****



Dear Dr. ***** and *****:



I had the pleasure of seeing ***** ***** in the Neurosurgery

Clinic.  As you may recall, he is a *****-year-old right-handed male

with a past medical history of a *****/stroke, bilateral

spontaneous subdural hematomas of undetermined etiology, partial

seizures and a pulmonary embolus, being referred for prophylactic

meningeal artery embolization prior to starting anticoagulation. 

He has had a history of chronic subdural hematoma since 2014

after NSTEMI.  For MI, he was started on aspirin and Plavix.  He

developed headaches and was found to have a right subdural

hematoma and Plavix was discontinued in ***** *****, his right

subdural hematoma had resolved and as early as *****/*****/*****, he was

on aspirin 81 mg daily and ***** ***** *****, he had numbness and

tingling and he was found to have an acute confidence in the left

subdural hematoma and the aspirin was also stopped. 

Subsequently, he has been admitted with symptoms of aphasia and

right upper extremity weakness, was started on Trileptal in

addition to the Keppra he was on.  There is continued evidence of

ongoing subdural hematomas.  He has had an LP, which shows high

towel and beta amyloid concerning for increased Alzheimer

disease.  He was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

via Holter monitor for palpitations.  He also has a history of

pancreatitis from ***** ***** on a regular basis.  He was off

alcohol for a year, but admitted to have gone back to it.  He has

been given Cardizem for atrial fibrillation and also had a PE

earlier this year after a mobilization after surgery.  He had an

IVC filter, but was not anticoagulated due to spontaneous

subdural hematomas.



Past Medical History:  Significant for subdural hematomas, acute

necrotizing pancreatitis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes

mellitus, cirrhosis, left knee injury and repair, right knee

replacement, right rotator cuff tear repair, partial seizures.



Social History:  He lives with his wife, *****.  He has two

kids, ***** and *****.  He works as an accountant and he has

stopped alcohol intake as of ***** *****.



Family History:  Significant for father with coronary artery

disease.  Mother with colon cancer.



Medications are oxcarbazepine 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., Keppra 1000 mg

p.o. b.i.d., atorvastatin, glyburide, metformin.



On examination, he was blood pressure *****/*****, heart rate was 64

per minute.  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.  His memory

recent and remote was good.  Attention and concentration was

appropriate.  Pupils are equal and reacting to light. 

Extraocular movements are intact.  Face is symmetric.  Tongue was

in the midline.  Motor strength is 5/5 in all four extremities

except the left upper extremity with shoulder movement was

decreased from his previous surgery, but he still *****/*****.  Sensation

to light touch was intact.  Reflexes were *****/***** and symmetric in

the upper extremities, not elicited in the lower extremities. 

Gait was normal.  Coordination was normal.



Review of CT scan shows bilateral small ***** extending from

frontal to occipital regions.



Impression:  The subdural hematomas are not causing him any

problems currently and he is asymptomatic, however, because of

the multiple hemorrhages in the past, I feel that he would be at

a high risk for recurrence if he were to start anticoagulation. 

He has multiple risk factors including PE and atrial fibrillation

in the past and is at high risk for *****, stroke from his

paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is as high as 8% per year. 

I would favor embolization of the middle meningeal artery

bilaterally and starting on anticoagulation.  I would plan to do

it as two separate interventions so as to minimize the risk of

loss of vision.  I went over it in great detail with the patient.

 He will talk to his wife and get back to us if he decides to

proceed with it.



Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of

your patient.



Sincerely,





***** *****. ***** *****

Note Title: Bedside Swallowing Evaluation (1)

Signed by ***** *****. *****, *****,CCC-SLP License# 9973 on *****/*****/***** at 4:08 pm  Affiliation: *****

 

Bedside ***** Evaluation:



HPI: Thank you for the referral of this *****-year-old woman with a

history of dementia who is hospitalized with intraventricular and

subdural hemorrhages. Our service had attempted to see the

patient on two occasions, but the patient was inappropriate given

mental status.  The family had a goals of care discussion and the

patient is now CMO.  A feeding tube is not within goals of care. 

The patient has been more awake and alert.  Therefore, the family

requested our service was consulted to evaluate the patient's

oropharyngeal swallowing function to provide strategies to

maximize comfort and reduce aspiration risk.	



Imaging:  

*****/*****: ""Increased right basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis

and/or pneumonia.  Unchanged appearance of the left lung base."" 



WBC: Elevated



Pain: None reported



EVALUATION:



Cognition-Communication Status: The patient responded to three

questions intelligibly over the course of the evaluation. The

rest of her responses were unintelligible.  Unable to assess

orientation given mental status. She did not follow commands. 



ORAL *****: Unable to complete as the patient did not follow

commands



Dentition: Incomplete 

Secretions: Moist oral cavity; Light coat on tongue. 

Cough Strength: Adequate

***** Quality: WNL



PO TRIALS:

Positioning: ***** in bed on ***** 2

Consistencies Trialed: 

Ice chips

Ice cream via deep cut plastic spoon (black spoon), shallow white

plastic spoon.

Applesauce via spoon

Pureed fruit via squeezable packet

Nectar thick liquids via 60mL catheter syringe, spoon

Water via tsp

	



Oral Phase: Required stimulation to open her mouth. Decreased

stripping of the bolus from the spoon. Particular difficulty with

stripping ice cream from the deeper spoon (black colored),

improved with more shallow spoon (white spoon). The patient

additionally had difficulty stripping PO from the spoon, losing

small amounts of all PO anteriorly from the spoon. The patient

benefitted from using a 60mL catheter syringe placed into the

front of the patient's mouth to administer liquids and purees.

Mild prolonged A-P transfer. Intermittent bolus holding noted.

Mild oral residue following the completion of the swallow.



Pharyngeal Phase: Palpable laryngeal elevation which appeared

reduced and delayed. She swallowed up to six times per bolus. The

patient had a vigorous cough with thin water via spoon with tears

in her eyes.  Intermittent coughing/throat clearing throughout

the evaluation with all consistencies, similar in nature to

baseline cough, but more frequent.  



SUMMARY/IMPRESSION: The patient presents with overt s/s of

aspiration and is at high risk for aspiration of all

consistencies. The patient's family has decided to feed the

patient accepting aspiration risk. Therefore, our service is

consulted to determine ways to reduce aspiration risk and

increase comfort while eating.  Given impressions at the bedside,

would recommend that the patient avoid thin liquids as these

appeared to cause discomfort, but the patient may have solids

that melt into thin liquids (i.e. ice cream, ice chips). Avoid

chewable solids as these may result in an asphyxiation event.

Additionally, the patient may enjoy smooth purees, and nectar

thick liquids. See recommendations below to encourage reduce

aspiration and promote comfortable swallowing. The patient's

family was given contact information for the clinician should any

further questions arise.



This swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake

***** (FOIS) rating of *****/*****



PLAN: Our service to remain available if questions/concerns

arise, but will not follow-up unless contacted.



Goal: 

-Patient will successfully consume PO without discomfort.





EDUCATION:

Provided to:  *****, *****, MD 

Content: Strategies to minimize discomfort while eating.

Mode: *****, Written

Understanding: Verbally expressed understanding.



RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ***** ***** INTAKE (accepting aspiration risk):

1)	Consume smooth pureed solids, ice cream, ice chips, and nectar

thick liquids.

2)	Medications: Give liquid medications mixed with nectar thick

liquids (if medications are thin) via syringe as needed

3)	Oral care: Q4 oral care. Perform oral care prior to PO

4)	Aspiration Precautions:

- 1:1 assistance with all PO

- Sit upright for all PO

- Remain sitting upright following all PO for 30 minutes

- Give liquids/solids as able using a 60mL catheter syringe

administering small amounts to the FRONT of the mouth or via

spoon.

- Discontinue if any signs of discomfort

- Present empty spoon if patient is holding the bolus

- Check for oral pocketing

- Provide stimulation to bottom lip to encourage the patient to

open her mouth.

	



These recommendations/plan of care were reviewed/discussed with

the patient, RN, and medical team.

*****/sneezing/coughing thought to be inciting event for

intracranial *****. CT and MRI brain confirm diagnosis of

intracranial hypotension with + diffuse *****

enhancement. Per Neuroradiology, MRI C/T/L spine w/o contrast may

be sufficient to find site of CSF leak, thus ***** necessity

for CT Myelogram.

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. ***** schedule Pt for repeat EBP at ***** ***** at next

available time with Dr. *****. 

2. ***** follow up with MRI imaging regarding site of leak.

3. ***** continue with conservative ***** such as IVF and

She is unsure of if she suffered a head strike but denies LOC. Her sister came to visit the patient and called EMS upon noticing frank oral trauma. The patient also has a black eye around her left eye - per the patient's husband, the patient may have fallen a couple of days ago, but the patient does not recall. The patient denies any headache, visual loss, lateralized weakness/numbness, or syncope.       The patient is currently followed by Dr. ***** for her myelodysplastic syndrome and actively receives chemotherapy with Vidaza (Azacitidine). She is currently on C1 of this medication, received D5 on *****/*****/***** but unfortunately was not able to tolerate D6 or ***** due to adverse

She was admitted to ***** medicine *****/***** to *****/***** for N/V with hospital course c/b neutropenia (ANC 480 on admission) and transaminitis (felt secondary to chemotherapy).The patient reports that her oral abscess has continued to bleed intermittently.     A targeted ROS was performed and significant for the following:  History of HTN: Denies  Use of antiplatelet/anticoagulant: Denies - only uses APAP for pain  History of renal/liver disease: Transaminitis as noted    -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Hospital course:    # Goals of care  Ms. ***** valued functional independence in her life prior to the current hospitalization. She had multiple falls before presentation. She had previously told Dr. ***** and her son that she would not want to be intubated, resuscitated, receive a G-tube, or live a life requiring significant medical support. Her family elected to make her CMO on *****/***** when her mental status did not recover despite uptitration of AEDs. She passed away several hours after transition to CMO, comfortable and surrounded by family.    # Complicated mild TBI: NCHCT showed bifrontal, anterior *****, and tentorial leaflet acute subdural hemorrhage, small right frontal hemorrhagic contusion, which was stable on repeat imaging. On *****/***** she had intermittent confusion, so a repeat NCHCT was ordered which showed slight interval increase in hemorrhage.  She remained in the neuro ICU overnight and received additional platelet transfusions. She had a repeat NCHCT on *****/***** ***** which showed stability of hemorrhage.     ***** was consulted on admission and recommended no intervention. She was treated with keppra 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis (D1=*****/*****) which should be continued for 7 days. Her ***** were maintained at <140 and then after ***** 
liberalized to <160. She briefly required nicardipine ggt to maintain this goal, and it was subsequently tapered off, and she was started on captopril. When she was no longer able to take PO, she was transitioned to nicardipine gtt until she was made CMO.    # Myelodysplastic syndrome with severe thrombocytopenia:   Followed by Dr. *****. Neutropenia, and severe thrombocytopenia present on admission. Hematology consulted. For correction of coagulopathy, and recommended goal INR < 1.4; she received Vit K 10 mg x1 in ED; with improvement in ***** to 1.0. Given her intracranial hemorrhage, our goal platelets was > 50; however, this was felt to be unachievable per Dr. *****. She received 2U of platelets in the ED with no increase her platelets (remained ***** ***** ***** *****). We ***** her 1u of platelets and immediately rechecked a CBC, and her platelets again only bumped to 3 on *****/*****. Antiplatelet antibodies are pending. She was transfused pRBCs for goal HCT>21 (received total of 3u). After her repeat NCHCT showed slight increase in bleeding on *****/***** s/p repeat 2U platelet transfusion leading to transient count increase from 3 to 16. Further transfusions did not lead to increases in platelet count, so ***** testing was sent and transfusion were help except for in cases of bleeding. Patient developed mild epistaxis *****/***** with a placement count of 1. Her MDS was felt to have a poor prognosis overall even if her mental status were to recover, so her family elected to make her CMO when her mental status failed to improve and she developed worsening bleeding.    # Altered mental status and generalized discharges on EEG: on *****/***** she had change in her exam from AOx3 to *****. LTM was placed and showed LPDs-->*****. Her levetiracetam was gradually increased to 1.5 g BID and lacosamide was added and increased to 150 mg BID without improvement in mental status of significant changes in *****. Though she received one trial of 0.5mg IV 
ativan resulting in return to ***** ***** mental status, further trials did not yield significant improvement. Modafinil 100 mg BID was trialed, but she was unable to take it.    # Neutropenic fever: She spiked a temperature to 103.9 while getting pRBCs on *****/*****. She was cultured and started on cefepime for neutropenic fever. pRBCs were stopped. There was also concern for a transfusion reaction given her fever occurred while pRBCs were transfusion; however, she was otherwise hemodynamically stable, and a sample was sent to the blood bank. Transfusion reaction interpretation was negative. She had a CT chest, abdomen, pelvis on admission which showed no pulmonary or intraabdominal pathology. Ultimately her blood cx from admission grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas. She was ***** on *****/***** and cultures were negative. She was treated with cefepime (*****/*****-) with a plan to continue for at least 2 weeks.    # Oral trauma, loose teeth. Evaluated by OMFS for extraction, which patient deferred until platelets increase.    # Hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia: likely due to poor PO intake, present in the past.

presents after being found down minimally responsive at a police station with GCS 8.     Pt was reportedly out drinking with friends last night. They parted ways and then pt was found down. Initially thought to just be EtOH but EMS was called and was concerned for assault so pt brought to *****.      At ***** ***** reportedly further declined requiring intubation. NCHCT at ***** reportedly showed hyperdensity at the sagittal sinus with scattered ***** and nondisplaced skull fracture. Repeat NCHCT reportedly stable.     After transfer pt had repeat NCHCT and also MRI/MRV which showed likely venous epidural hemorrhage and patent venous sinuses. Admitted to neuro-ICU.    ---------------------------------------  Hospital Course by Problem  ---------------------------------------  # Epidural hemorrhage  The presumed mechanism of injury was trauma, likely due to strike at the vertex with a blunt object. MRV was negative for venous sinus thrombosis and the patient's intracranial hemorrhage was stable on serial imaging over 8 hours. Thought to likely be venous hemorrhage given stability of bleed. His SBP goal was maintained as <140 for 24 hours then liberalized to <160. With liberalization to <160 pt did not require PO anti-HTN medication. Plan to f/u in ***** clinic as outpatient.     # Concern for seizure  Given the patient's neurological status on presentation, he was loaded with keppra 2g and continued on keppra 1g BID. He was also placed on LTM, which was unremarkable. Plan to continue keppra for 7 days only given unclear if pt had seizure, and if he did it would have clearly been provoked. Normal EEG reassuring. Keppra for 7d completed prior to discharge.    # Substance use  The patient's EtOH level upon arrival to ***** was 188, and so he was started on thiamine, folate, and MVI and monitored for withdrawal, with the plan being to start a phenobarbital taper vs CIWA if he started to demonstrate signs and symptoms of withdrawal. 
Also with +cocaine on UTox. Addiction medicine was consulted.    # Found down  The patient had a C collar placed. Upon initial attempt to clear the collar clinically, the patient endorsed pain upon neck flexion, and so it was continued. Repeat attempt to clear the collar clinically unsuccessful given persistent pain. Plan to try again *****/***** and if still having pain will pursue MRI C-Spine. The patient's CK was initially 850, and so he was hydrated with IVF and ***** ***** down to 323. ***** *****-***** on *****/***** was normal so C-collar was removed    # Respiratory failure  The patient was intubated due to concern for airway protection. At *****, he was doing well on minimal ventilator settings and was following commands briskly, even through sedation. As such, he was extubated *****, swiftly converted to room air.    #Hyponatremia  Just prior to discharge his sodium was downtrending. We tried an IV bolus of fluids with decline in ***** to 130 therefore etiology more likely SIADH than hypovolemia. He was placed on fluid restriction and given salt tabs.     #Pain  From his trauma, patient was experiencing pain and headache. He received tylenol but also required *****-***** doses of PRN oxycodone or dilaudid. He was discharged on a small amount to continue taking at home.

You were monitored closely by Neurology and Neurosurgery and did not require any surgical intervention. You had an MRI of 
your cervical spine which was normal. You were evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy and greatly improved in your function, but will need more time to recover. We recommend you discuss ways to address your substance use with your PCP.    We have scheduled you an appointment with ***** *****, Dr. ***** *****, on ***** ***** at 10:45AM (can reschedule at *****-*****-*****). Please attend this appointment to re-establish care.    You will be discharged on Dilaudid for pain control. This medication can make you constipated so you can take Miralax (an over the counter medication).   Your salt level was low which is a result of your injury. You will need to take salt tabs three times a day, your PCP will help you wean this over time. You should also restrict what you drink to no more than 1500 ml per day. If you are drinking fluids, it is better to drink fluids with electrolytes (e.g. Gatorade, smart water, crystal light).

They recommend you DO NOT take your home aspirin for 2 weeks. You do not need to schedule a follow-up appointment but please call (*****) *****-***** if you have any questions or concerns.    You were seen by Dr. *****, Orthopedics, for management of your sacral and clavicle fracture. They 
recommend you bear weight as tolerated and follow-up in their clinic. Please call *****-*****-***** to schedule an appointment in 1-2 weeks.    Getting around your home safely can be a challenge if you have injuries or health problems that make it easy for you to *****. Loose rugs and furniture in ***** are among the dangers for many older people who have problems walking or who have poor eyesight. People who have conditions such as arthritis, osteoporosis, or dementia also have to be careful not to *****.  You can make your home ***** with a few simple measures.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  Taking care of yourself  You may get dizzy if you do not drink enough water. To prevent dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, enough so that your urine is light yellow or clear like water. Choose water and other caffeine-free clear liquids. If you have kidney, heart, or liver disease and have to limit fluids, talk with your doctor before you increase the amount of fluids you drink.  Exercise regularly to improve your strength, muscle tone, and balance. Walk if you can. Swimming may be a good choice if you cannot walk easily.  Have your vision and hearing checked each year or any time you notice a change. If you have trouble seeing and hearing, you might not be able to avoid objects and could lose your balance.  Know the side effects of the medicines you take. Ask your doctor or pharmacist whether the medicines you take can affect your balance. Sleeping pills or sedatives can affect your balance.  Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Alcohol can impair your balance and other senses.  Ask your doctor whether calluses or ***** on your feet need to be removed. If you wear 
loose-fitting shoes because of calluses or *****, you can lose your balance and *****.  Talk to your doctor if you have numbness in your feet.  Preventing falls at home  Remove raised doorway thresholds, ***** rugs, and *****. Repair loose carpet or raised areas in the floor.  Move furniture and electrical cords to keep them out of walking paths.  Use nonskid floor wax, and wipe up spills right away, especially on ceramic tile floors.  If you use a walker or cane, put rubber tips on it. If you use crutches, clean the ***** of them regularly with an abrasive pad, such as ***** wool.  Keep your house well lit, especially *****, *****, and outside *****. Use night-lights in areas such as ***** and bathrooms. Add extra light switches or use remote switches (such as switches that go on or off when you clap your hands) to make it easier to turn lights on if you have to get up during the night.  Install ***** ***** on *****.  Move items in your cabinets so that the things you use a lot are on the lower shelves (about waist level).  Keep a cordless phone and a flashlight with new batteries by your bed. If possible, put a phone in each of the main rooms of your house, or carry a cell phone in case you ***** and cannot reach a phone. Or, you can wear a device around your neck or wrist. You push a button that sends a signal for help.  Wear low-heeled shoes that fit well and give your feet good support. Use footwear with nonskid soles. Check the heels and soles of your shoes for wear. Repair or replace worn heels or soles.  Do not wear socks without shoes on wood floors.  Walk on the ***** when the ***** are slippery. If you live in ***** ***** that gets snow and ice in the *****, ***** salt on slippery steps and *****.  Preventing falls in the bath  Install grab bars and nonskid ***** inside and outside your shower or tub and near the toilet and *****.  Use shower chairs and bath benches.  Use a 
hand-held shower head that will allow you to sit while showering.  Get into a tub or shower by putting the weaker leg in first. Get out of a tub or shower with your strong side first.  Repair loose toilet ***** and consider installing a raised toilet seat to make getting on and off the toilet easier.  Keep your bathroom door unlocked while you are in the shower.

DIAGNOSIS 

Impairments of Body Functions and Structures, Activity

Limitations and Participation Restrictions

- Impaired transfers 

- Impaired gait 

- Impaired balance 

- Impaired strength 

- Impaired motor function 



Clinical Impression/Prognosis: Pt is a ***** year old male with

history or HTN who presents to physical therapy during

hospitalization for report of gait imbalance and recent falls

with findings of small subdural hematoma. Pt is functioning well

below baseline limited by impairments in body structure and

function including decreased force production and balance. Pt

also presents with activity limitations in mobility and self care

contributing to difficulty in fulfilling societal role of spouse

and father. Pt demonstrated difficulty with maintaining balance

during dynamic gait activities. Increase sway noted with balance

activities when visual input removed placing patient and increase

risk of falls. During 5x sit to stand assessment, a measure of

functional lower limb muscle strength and used to *****

functional change of transitional movements, pt scored >15 cut of

scores indicating an increase risk of falls. 

The patient's Basic Mobility ***** Form AM-PAC score less than or

equal to 17 is consistent with a requirement of rehabilitation at

discharge. Pt will most benefit from ***** to interdisciplinary

rehabilitation to maximize functional potential. Anticipate

patient would be able to tolerate >3 hours PT/OT/SLP daily. DC to

rehab is supported by AM-PAC and Dynamic Gait index, and need for

CGA for safety with mobility. Pt has excellent prognosis to

return to ***** ***** of function and home discharge after

rehab due to ambulation during acute care stay and gross strength

and sensation intact.  Pt has good prognosis for eventual DC home

from rehab given strong social supports from family and prior

level of functioning. Potentially limiting prognostic indicators

include age. Acute PT will continue to follow while in house to

progress goals as outlined below. 



Goals:               Time *****: 1 Week  

- Pt/caregiver will I verbalize understanding of falls

*****, plan of care

- Pt will score greater than or equal to 20 on the Activity

Measure for Post-Acute Care. (MDC 4.72)

- Pt will score greater than or equal to *****/***** on Dynamic gait

index

- Pt will be able to complete 5x sit to stand in less than 20

seconds





Current Status: 

***** Mobility Based on the results of the AM-PAC, the patient

presents with CMS severity: 40%-60% impaired (CK) = AM-PAC 15-19





Goal Status: 

***** Mobility with CMS severity: 40%-60% impaired (CK) = AM-PAC

15-19



Recommended Discharge: (X )rehab ( )home 



Treatment Plan:

Progress functional mobility including bed mobility, transfers,

gait with SC as tolerated

Balance training

Pt/caregiver education RE: falls precautions

D/C planning



Frequency/Duration: 3-5x/week for 1 week  



Recommendations for Nursing:

Pt is at high risk for deconditioning please encourage frequent

mobility and maximize independence in *****.

Amb with SC and CGA 3x/day.

Assist of 1 for out of bed to chair with SC 3x/day.

Please use pressure relieving air cushion / chair alarm when out

of bed.

Normalize sleep-wake cycle to decrease risk of delirium.



Patient agrees with the above goals and is willing to participate

in the rehabilitation program.  Please indicate with an 'X': Yes

(x) or No ( ). If no please explain:

somnolence/lethargy.     Per excellent neurology consult note By Dr. ***** dated *****/*****, patient has dysarthria at baseline but still can answer questions in short phrases, though difficult to understand sometimes based on chart review. Per collateral from wife, he gets more confused and forget things more frequently. At times, he needed to be reminded that he was no longer working. He could also get angry if things do not go his way, requiring family members to provide papers so he could pretend that he was at work. He is still very unsteady on his feet, though he is able to use a walker, sits in a chair and eats by himself on his good days. Patient had a last fall on ***** ***** (see below). In addition, he has had more movements and nightmares at night, kicking a caregivers, concerning for possible hallucination and agitation.     Of note, he had a recent admission to *****/SKF *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/***** for worsening confusion/behavioral issues as described above along with writhing movements. At that time, routine EEG showed diffuse bilateral theta > delta slowing, but no epileptiform discharges. CTA did not show any new abnormalities.  This was in the setting of being started on a new medication *****, which was then discontinued after the discussion with outpatient neurologist Dr. *****, and Seroquel was started and titrated (last dose 12.5 mg twice daily). Cardiology interrogated pacemaker and ***** its good function.  His pacemaker showed a known atrial fibrillation, but no significant RVR or any other arrhythmia.      Prior to the last admission, patient was admitted in ***** ***** when he passed out, with limb *****, and was in the ICU for 5 days, and he was found to have cardiac pauses and a pacemaker was placed. Event thought to be convulsive syncope. EEG x 24 hrs without seizure. He had ***** s/p pacemaker, and event was attributed to cardiac arrhythmia.     A week prior to presentation on ***** 
*****, he had a unwitnessed ***** at the nursing home and received a CT scan at ***** Hospital, which noted a large subdural hematoma measuring up to 10 mm per report. Patient was continued on Apixaban, last given at 6pm on *****/*****/*****. On *****/***** per collateral from nursing home, patient continued to be confused at his baseline (""believes he needs to go outside to get his shirt, thinks he needs to get out somewhere""), though per consult note patient found to be ***** incomprehensible words. Notably, RN noted low grade tempt 100.7 at night, and patient was noted to be more somnolent than his baseline and nonresponsive to verbal cues, though still responsive to noxious stimuli. This change in mental status was discussed with family who requested him to be brought to ***** hospital, where repeat non-contrast CT head demonstrated at least 10 mm acute on subacute subdural hematoma. He again noted to have a low degree tempt of 100.6. Patient received IV Keppra. Given his acute on chronic subdural hematoma and acutely worsened mental status, the decision was made to transfer him to ***** for further management.     Upon arrival to ***** *****, neurology was consulted immediately, before any labs or imaging, as the patient was found unresponsive.  When evaluation, patient was very slow to respond, but moved all extremities, could report his name, and followed simple appendicular commands. Review of system is limited due to baseline dysarthria and worsened mental status. CT head/angio demonstrated stable acute on chronic SDH. ***** deferred any surgical intervention at the moment. Patient was admitted to inpatient neurology service for further management.     =========================  Hospital course *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****  =========================  # Altered mental status / increased somnolence and lethargy  # Parkinson's disease c/b orthostasis and hallucination  # Concerns for inadequately controlled PD  Patient with 
diminished mental status at baseline presented with acutely worsened mental status and increased lethargy. Patient had was recently found to have SDH in the setting of frequent falls, though repeat CT demonstrated acute on chronic appearance and stable size without any mass effect. Given this known SDH, patient's AMS was initially concerning for seizure secondary to SDH and/or post-ictal confusion. However, given his prompt improvement in mental status after Sinemet, it seemed overall likely that patient has been ***** on Sinemet, which is consistent ***** outpatient neurologist's report that his regimen at nursing home has been lower than his prior doses. In addition, given his recorded fevers, metabolic encephalopathy is also considered, though the fever could be due to his DVT and so far infectious work up is negative without leukocytosis and electrolytes are within normal limits (see # Fever below). Other ***** that were considered and deemed unlikely were cardiac arrhythmia that he last presented with, though now s/p pacemaker or orthostatic hypotension. Per discussion with outpatient neurologist Dr. *****'s impression that patient was *****, patient was restarted on his prior Sinemet dose per his recommendation (Sinemet *****/***** 1 tablet at 9AM, 1 tablet at 1PM, 2 tabs at 5PM, 1 tablet 9PM). In addition, previous treatment plan was to optimize his Seroquel dosing to address his hallucination with the hope that it will allow for more Sinemet dosing. As such, patient was gradually restarted on home Seroquel 25mg at 6pm and 12.5gm at 9am, as his mental status improved avoid worsening hallucination. For his orthostatic hypotension, patient was continued on home midodrine 10mg daily at 9am + 5mg BID at 12pm and 4pm and fludrocortisone 0.2mg at 9am. Although there was initially concerns for dysphagia and aspiration leading to NGT placement, patient's swallowing mechanics improved to baseline 
upon Sinemet administration, and SLP cleared him to regular diet and thin liquid that he was on previously. Spot EEG did not show epileptiform activity so seizure was thought to be unlikely, and Keppra was discontinued. Given his improved mental status on Sinemet uptitration, patient was discharged back to *****. At the time of discharge, his final regiment was Sinemet *****/***** 2.5 tablets at 8AM, 2.5 tablets at 12 noon, 3 tablets at ***** ***** and 2 tablets at 8PM. Patient was scheduled to follow up with his outpatient neurologist on ***** *****.    # AoC SDH  As explained above, patient was found to have SDH on ***** ***** after a *****. Repeat CT scan demonstrated stable acute on chronic SDH. Neurosurgery who evaluated him in the ED deferred any surgical intervention and recommended holding home apixaban 5mg BID was held for two weeks (until *****/*****) due to his SDH. Patient was scheduled to receive a repeat CT head on *****/***** on the same day he was scheduled with his outpatient neurologist, after which the decision to restart ***** will be made by his provider.     # RLE DVT  # Fever without leukocytosis  Initially based on his recorded fever, there were concerns that possible infectious etiologies were contributing to his toxic metabolic picture, though no clear source of infection found. UA with RBC (I/s/o foley) without LE/nitrite. CBC without leukocytosis. COVID negative. CXR without any evidence of PNA. Given his history of DVT/PE (though was on apixaban), ***** was obtained, which demonstrated LLE DVT. However, given given SDH and distal DVT that is less likely to embolize to cause PE, home apixaban continued to be held for two weeks two weeks (until *****/*****) with plan to restart apixaban after ***** ***** once repeat CT head is obtained to ensure that SDH has been stabilized.     # Afib  # Cardiac arrhythmia s/p pacemaker  As explained above per #AoC SDH, home apixaban was held for two weeks (until *****/*****) with plan to restart 
once SDH has been stabilized. Patient was noted to have Afib with RVR to 120s, for which he was briefly on metop tartrate 6.25 *****, but HR promptly stabilized during the hospitalization without any need for beta blocker.     # GOC discussion  Per daughter who is his HCP, patient remained full code confirmed. Outpatient neurologist also confirmed full code for now after discussing with patient himself.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    POST CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY (MMA) EMBOLIZATION ORDERS:  There is no need to keep the puncture site covered.   No heavy lifting (10 pounds) or straining for two weeks after the procedure.   No straining, lifting or activity that puts increased pressure on the area that is healing.   You should wait at least 5 days before resuming exercise.  Do not take baths or go swimming for at least 5 days after the angiogram.    DIET:  Resume your normal diet and drink plenty of fluids.  If you are taking narcotics increase your fiber intake.    MEDICATIONS:  You do not have to take pain medication unless it is needed.    Please wean off narcotic pain medication by the follow up visit.  Often pain medication and anesthesia can cause constipation.  Take stool softeners while taking narcotic pain medication.  You can take an over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).  If you become constipated, try products such as Miralax, Dulcolax, or Milk of Magnesia.  You should have a bowel movement at least every 3 days.   Do not strain when going to the bathroom.   Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.   Do not drive while taking narcotic pain medication.     Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc., as this can increase your chances of bleeding.   Check with your surgeon before taking if you are unsure.     GENERAL INFORMATION:  A little soreness after the procedure is normal.   Bruising in the area is normal.   Significant pain can be a sign that something is wrong.   You may feel a small bump at your groin site if that was the 
access point for your angiogram.   It is the closure device.    Watch for signs of infection including pain, warmth, redness, or fever.   Please call the office if you have significant or new pain.   If you develop any new or unusual back pain, bruising at the puncture site.  Please call the office immediately if you notice any bleeding from the site.   Please call the office with any questions or concerns.     For urgent issues during non-business hours, please call the main hospital line *****-*****-***** and ask for the Neurosurgery resident on call to be paged.                      Exam   Temperature: 37.4 °C (99.3 °F) (*****/*****/***** 1456) | Heart Rate: 94 (*****/*****/***** 1456) | BP: (!) *****/***** (*****/*****/***** 1456) | Respiratory Rate: 18 (*****/*****/***** 1151)  | SpO2: 98 % (*****/*****/***** 1456)  O2 Device: None (Room air) (*****/*****/***** 1456)  O2 Flow Rate (L/min): 2 | FiO2 (%): 21 % (*****/*****/***** 1400)      Weight: 106.6 kg (235 lb) (*****/*****/***** 0642)  Height: 190.5 cm (6' 3"") (*****/*****/***** 0642)         BMI (Calculated): 29.37 (*****/*****/***** 0642)    Discharge Exam    Significant Discharge Exam Findings: *****  PERRL, EOMI, peripheral gaze intact, FS, TM  ***** intact  *****/***** BUE throughout  *****/***** BLE throughout  SILT  2+ DP/PT  Groin incision soft, flat without ecchymosis             Orientation Level: Oriented X3   Cognition: Follows commands         Speech: Clear     Special Needs    Special Needs: None              Data/Results    Results are shown for the following tests if performed (CBC, ***** 7, Mg, Coag).

He had multilevel cervical stenosis w/ myelopathy and presents to inpatient rehabilitation following a suboccipital decompression, C1-C7 laminectomy and medial facetectomy on *****/*****/***** with Dr. *****.    Hospital Course While at *****:    1. Rehabilitation: The patient improved functionally throughout the hospitalization. At this time the patient's functional status is listed below:    Physical Therapy Discharge Functional report: At the time of admission the patient was Supervision with rolling to the left and Supervision with rolling to the right. The patient was Moderate assist with supine to sit activities, and Minimum assist x 1 with sit to stand activities. The patient was Contact guard x 1 with Transfers and Minimum assist x 1 with ***** - rolling for ambulation. Ambulation Distance: 50 ft x 2.

Maximum assistance with upper body dressing and Maximum assistance with lower body dressing. Minimum assistance with shower/tub transfers, Maximum assistance for bathing/showering.    Patient will be discharged home to ***** ***** rehabilitation process with therapy as arranged by the case manager.    2. Pain: Patient's pain was difficult to manage during this admission. He has minimal pain while lying in bed but his pain increases significantly when sitting, moving, or trying to complete functional tasks. He complained of pain in his neck and bilateral shoulders. His most severe pain comes from his R shoulder and travels down his R arm. Patient's surgeon, Dr. ***** was informed of the pain and recommended a course of steroids, unfortunately steroids had minimal effect on pain. Celebrex was started also with minimal effect and eventually discontinued. A fentanyl patch was tried and discontinued shortly after due 
to sedation and confusion.     Patient does not consistently ask for prn pain medications. His pain regimen worked best with scheduled oxycodone 5 mg at 0900 and 1300 along with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn. Patient also took gabapentin 800 mg TID, valium 5 mg nightly, and acetaminophen 650 mg q6h. Voltaren gel and lidocaine patches were added with some effect.     Non-opiate alternatives were considered and deemed inadequate alone. I discussed the risks associated with the opioid prescribed. Prior to prescribing the opioid, I utilized the ***** website to review the patient's previous prescriptions. A prescription was provided to the patient for Oxycodone. Patient plans to continue to taper Oxycodone as discussed.    3. DVT prophylaxis: Patient was on DVT prophylaxis Lovenox 40 mg q24h SC, he should continue Lovenox while at *****.     4. Spine: Patient had multilevel cervical stenosis w/ myelopathy and presents to inpatient rehabilitation following a suboccipital decompression, C1-C7 laminectomy and medial facetectomy on *****/*****/***** with Dr. *****. Patient received intensive PT/OT during his admission, progress outlined above. Patient had a repeat cervical MRI on *****/*****/***** after persistent pain affecting his function. The MRI was concerning for ventral subdural hematoma, however the hematoma is expected to reabsorb and surgical intervention is not recommended at this time per Dr. *****. Per Dr. *****, there is no clear explanation for ongoing pain, the patient had no radiculopathy pre-op and his post MRI looks good with the exception of some questionable foramina stenosis. Patient will follow up with neurosurgery again in 1 month.     5. Cardiovascular: Patient reports a history of SVT in the setting of anxiety due to stressful work environment with his brother. He was started on digoxin at that time for that problem. This was over 40 years ago. PCP is weaning this medication appropriately. He had a history of chest pain with 
negative stress test.  As well as an echo which only showed mild aortic valve thickening and no stenosis (2014). Patient continued digoxin 125 mcg daily and can continue to wean as an outpatient. Patient has a known history of hypertension managed on doxazosin 8 mg daily and verapamil 120 mg daily. Patient's vital signs were monitored 3 times a day. Patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout the hospital course and patient denied any cardiovascular symptoms throughout the stay.     6. Psychiatry: Patient was followed by Psychology consult team while at *****. Patient was found to be coping well with his hospitalization.    7. GU: At the time of discharge patient is voiding spontaneously with no noted postvoid residuals. He has a previous history of urinary retention. He is managed on dutasteride 0.5 mg daily, doxazosin 8 mg daily and tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily.     8. Pulmonary: Patient remained stable on room air and denied respiratory symptoms throughout the rehab course. Incentive spirometer education was provided and encouraged. Patient has a history of OSA and continued his home CPAP.    9. Neurology: Patient has a known history of normal pressure hydrocephalus with a VPS placed in 2019. His gait has been mildly impaired. He does not experience any urinary incontinence. Neuro exam remained stable throughout hospital course.    10. Endocrine: Patient reports that he has a known history of diabetes and was previously on metformin 500 mg daily. He reports that he is no longer on that medication due to well-controlled blood sugar. He does report that in his prior hospitalization his blood sugars were elevated given the administration of steroids. Patient's blood sugar was monitored daily, eventual blood sugar checks were discontinued due to consistent well controlled sugars.     11. GI/Nutrition: Patient was seen by nutrition consultant. PO fluids and high protein diet were encouraged. Patient was 
maintained on stool softeners and laxatives scheduled and as needed to maintain regular bowel movements.    12. FEN/Renal: Chemistries were checked weekly throughout the hospital course. Renal function and electrolytes remained WNL. PO fluids were encouraged.    13. Hematology: Patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable throughout the hospital stay. No signs of acute bleed. Patient has known history of giant cell arteritis and was previously managed on prednisone 2.5 mg daily.    14. LFTs: Abdominal exam remained benign and LFTs were ***** weekly.    The patient is scheduled for discharge to SNF. I reviewed the care plan, medications, and followup plan with the patient and case manager and ***** the medication list with the patient.

Please identify the type of implant in the free text field and scan any related documentation ***** ***** Manager under the type of Outside Procedure. No    Does the patient have a known prior MRI contrast reaction? No                     Discharge instructions and important events and results    Anticoagulation    Please continue Lovenox 40mg injections subcutaneously once daily while at *****.       Wound Care    You may leave your posterior neck incision open to air.     If there is any concern for a wound infection, contact your surgeon immediately. Do NOT start taking antibiotics without consulting with your surgeon.      Physical Activity    Activity as tolerated.     Continue to follow physical therapy 
instructions after discharge.    You should be up and walking as much as possible.      Pain Management    Unless you have a history of liver dysfunction, you may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor pain. Do not exceed greater than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen in a 24-hour time period.     You were prescribed an opioid (narcotic) medication to help manage more severe pain. This class of medications can work well to reduce pain but can be dangerous if used improperly. The following information will help to keep you safe.     Safe Use of Opioids  Take opioids only as prescribed. Never take more than instructed, even if you feel your pain is not well managed. Improper use of opioids is a leading cause of accidental death.  Do not combine opioids with alcohol, medicines used to calm anxiety, or other medications that cause sleepiness or sedation.  There is a chance of becoming addicted to this medication. If you have a personal or family history of addiction, this risk is higher. It is important to share this information with your prescriber in order to keep you safe.  Opioid medications can impair your ability to drive or operate other types of machinery safely and you should not drive while taking this medication.     Safe Storage  Your medications are prescribed for only you. Do not share your medication with friends or family members.  Opioid medications must be stored properly, out of the reach of children or others who may be at risk of ingesting them.  Keep opioid medications locked in a safe or lock box (one can be purchased at a pharmacy).     Safe Disposal  Unused medication should be removed from the household as soon as possible through a *****-sponsored drug take-back program. You can find a disposal site near you at: *****://*****.*****.*****.*****/*****.  If a program is not available, then the FDA recommends flushing unused opioid medication down the toilet to prevent exposure and harm to 
others. See FDA website for medicines recommended for disposal by flushing. *****://*****.*****.*****/*****/*****/*****.*****    Common Side Effects of Opioids  Opioids can cause constipation. You should take a stimulant laxative like senna while taking opioids. Opioids can also cause allergic reactions, sedation, respiratory depression (decreased drive to breathe), nausea, vomiting, urinary problems, and itching. Contact your prescriber if you develop these or other symptoms that concern you.      Partial ***** of Your Prescription  When filling your prescription, you can choose to receive fewer pills than prescribed from the pharmacy.  If you choose this option, you will not be able to receive the remainder of the prescribed pills at a later date.      As your pain level decreases, you should reduce the number of pills that you take and increase the time between doses in order to wean off of the narcotics as soon as possible. If you have been on narcotics for an extended period of time prior to this admission, do not abruptly stop taking them to avoid withdrawal. Please call your surgeon or PCP if you need guidance on tapering your narcotic medications. Avoid operating heavy machinery, driving, and drinking alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication.       Bowel Regimen    Narcotic pain medication commonly causes constipation. To make it easier to have a bowel movement, consider the following recommendations: Miralax daily and senna/Colace up to twice daily as needed.    Eat foods high in fiber such as fruits and vegetables.    Increase fluid intake.    Increase walking.    If you begin to experience loose stools or diarrhea, stop bowel medications.      Concerns    If you experience any of the symptoms below, please contact your surgeon or primary care physician right away. Please go to the nearest emergency room during weekends and after business hours.     Fever >101.***** or shaking chills.  Chest 
pain or shortness of breath  Increased redness or drainage from the wound (pus or active bleeding).  Severe or persistent nausea or vomiting.  New or persistent calf pain, redness, swelling, or numbness.

No    Intravenous Contrast Request: Per Radiologist discretion/standard protocol based on indications                     Discharge instructions and important events and results    You have a Medtronic Strata valve set at a performance level of 1.0  No connectors were placed.  It is MRI compatible.   It will need to reset after an MRI.   If the you are scheduled for an MRI please call Dr. *****'s office  to schedule a shunt check appointment after the MRI.    WOUND CARE:  -You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician (increased redness, drainage, foul odor, or other changes concerning to you).    -Your incision was closed with staples.  These will need to be removed. A follow up appointment has been provided to you prior to your discharge. Keep this appointment regardless of your wound closure technique. ____ ***** 
***** ***** CHANGING APPT ***** ***** AND ADDING *****!!!  -Keep your incision clean and dry.  -You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo 4 days after surgery.  -Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.     -Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your physician.    DIET  -Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated, and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may cause constipation.     MEDICATIONS:  -Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough to walk.     -Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.   -Medications that may be prescribed include:                -Narcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone) or Oxycodone.                 -An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or ***** enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and anesthesia can cause constipation.  -If you were on Aspirin,  prior to your surgery, you may safely resume taking this on ____  -Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding.   -If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.     ACTIVITY:  The first few weeks after you are 
discharged you may feel tired or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again. In general:  -Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor and therapist.  -Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you are feeling good.   -You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.  -If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.  -Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your physician.  -Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.  -Do your breathing exercises every two hours.    -Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you are awake.      WHEN TO CALL YOUR SURGEON:  With any surgery there are risks of complications. Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing. These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes. Call your Physician Immediately if you Experience:  -Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.  -*****, or blurred vision. Loss of vision, either partial or total.  -Hallucinations  -Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.  -***** neck, and/or a fever of 101.***** or more.  -Severe sensitivity to light.

Briefly, she is an ***** yo F w/ pmh notable for osteoporosis and hip fracture s/p replacement and arthritis who was transferred from ***** ***** ***** with left frontal IPH.    She was last seen well at 12pm on *****/*****/*****. At approximately 2:30pm she appeared confused and tired, and her legs appeared weak. She had no other focal symptoms and had been in her usual state of health w/o any c/f infection prior. Her confusion progressed and she was brought to ***** where initial CT demonstrated a frontal lobar hemorrhage with associated SAH and intraventricular extension. CTA was 
negative for aneurysm and ***** ***** was patent. A repeat CT 12 hours later demonstrated that the bleed remained stable. She was subsequently transferred for further management and possible surgical intervention, which was ultimately determined not to be indicated. At baseline, she walks around with a cane and is independent with ADLs. No concerns for dementia process per family though forgetful at times which has been attributed by her family to old age.     After admission an MRV was negative for venous sinus thrombosis. MRI demonstrated scattered cortical ***** and her hemorrhage was thought to be due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, though an underlying mass could not be fully excluded. She should have an MRI in 8-12 weeks after discharge.    Her blood pressure was elevated after presentation, so she was aggressively treated with oral antihypertensives, initially with captopril and then also with carvedilol and amlodipine. On the day of discharge the captopril was converted to lisinopril 20 mg daily and she remained on carvedilol 6.25 mg BID. The amlodipine was discontinued after brief asymptomatic hypotension the night prior to discharge. For worsened hypertension, we suggest increasing the lisinopril dose.    She remained somewhat encephalopathic after her bleed, disoriented to place and time. LTM showed no definite seizures but did show left frontal *****. She was started on levetiracetam 500 mg BID, and a follow-up EEG showed electrographic improvement with disappearance of ***** but continued focal slowing. She was also found to have a UTI and was treated with seven days of antibiotics, with ciprofloxacin to end on *****/*****/*****. Her encephalopathy was attributed to a combination of the hemorrhage, the UTI, and hospital delirium, and was expected to improve with treatment of the UTI, resolution of hemorrhage, and removal from the hospital environment. She was given a single dose of 25 mg quetiapine which 
resulted in excessive somnolence, so we suggest at rehab that a low dose of less-sedating antipsychotic such as 0.5 mg haldol be tried if needed for agitation.

HPI: 

====



***** is a ***** year old man with afib not currently on

anticoagulation secondary to recent spontaneous SDH (*****/*****/*****)

who presents to ED after ongoing word-finding difficulty.



History obtained by family at bedside. Last night patient could

not sleep. He has been having headaches since discharge that have

been relatively stable. This morning he work up early and was

initially interactive but then around 7:30AM began to display

word-finding difficulty with frequent paraphasic errors. He had

not significant worsening of his headache at this time but

overall he was less interactive, moving slower. No focal weakness

was noted. He had a period of lucidity at about 4:30PM where he

was fluently conversant and then he ***** to having

word-finding difficulty again.

IMAGING:

========

NCHCT: 

1. Allowing for differences in technique, left cerebral convexity

subdural hematoma is grossly unchanged, measuring up to 1.2 cm in

thickness. No areas of layering or contrast extravasation to

suggest active bleeding. 

2. There is similar partial effacement of the bilateral lateral

ventricles.  Increased rightward midline shift, previously

measuring up to 6 mm, now up to 10 mm, is more than expected for

differences in positioning, and is nonspecific in the absence of

a growing hematoma. Subtle diffuse loss of gray-white matter

differentiation throughout the left cerebral hemisphere may 

suggest cerebral edema. No definite acute large territory

infarction or frank obstructing hydrocephalus. If indicated, MR

may be obtained to better evaluate an underlying cause. 



CTA Head and Neck: 

  

1. No flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm greater than

3 mm within the circle of ***** and its principal intracranial

branches. No active extravasation within the left subdural

hematoma. 

2. No flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or dissection within the

major arteries of the neck. 

3. The dural venous sinuses are patent. 



ASSESSMENT:

===========



***** is a ***** year old man with recent spontaneous SDH while on

eliquis for afib who presented to ED for word-finding difficulty,

*****, with findings of new 10mm MLS on NCHCT but without

significant increase in *****. Of note, current symptoms on

presentation slightly different from prior symptoms, as he had

left numbness and left ***** at that time but did not have word

finding difficulty. 



His exam is notable for lethargy with some word-finding

difficulty 



I am concerned about the possibility that he may have suffered an

embolic stroke while being off anti-coagulation as the edema on

his NCHCT appears out of proportion to SDH. Alternatively, he may

have had an unwitnessed seizure or have subclinical seizures in

setting of worsening midline shift. Admission is warranted for

intervention as well as further evaluation of edema focus seen on

NCHCT resulting in midline shift.



The etiology of his non-traumatic SDH was thought to be eliquis

although ongoing work-up is still pending. His SDH is now >5 mm

with >10mm of mls suggesting he may benefit from surgical

intervention.



Recommendations:

- agree with admission to neurosurgical service

- neurology will follow as consulting service

- continue keppra as prescribed

- consider MRI brain to r/o infarct

- if speech arrests continue, could consider cvEEG



Patient discussed with Chief Resident Dr. *****.



***** *****, MD PhD

Addendum by ***** *****. *****, MD on *****/*****/***** at 5:05 pm:

Agree with above. On exam today patient had difficulty with

speech with fluency issues though relatively intact naming,

associated dysarthria and speech hesitancy. He was able to

complete the rest of my neurological exam which was non-focal

except for speech issues as above and oral-motor incoordination

(when asked to stick out tongue would purse lips etc.).  



Given he is planned for the OR tomorrow, MRI and cvEEG are not

necessary at this time.  If he has ongoing speech arrest

post-operatively though or his post-op head CT is concerning for

ongoing edema etc. out of proportion to expected SDH would

recommend MRI and cvEEG at that time. Given he is able to

complete the entire rest of my exam today, suspect that his

speech arrest issues are more related to irritability at the site

of his SDH rather than true seizures. In addition, a stroke

secondary to the hemorrhage would likely be secondary to pressure

effects on local blood vessels and surgery to remove the SDH

should help.  That being said, the edema on my read of the CT

doesn't seem out of proportion for the amount of SDH.



However, given his anticoagulation and anti-platelets are being

held he is at risk for a stroke, and any new additional

neurological exam findings would warrant consideration of head

imaging (CT vs. MRI) to look for a new stroke vs. expansion of

the hemorrhage. 



***** continue to follow along with you.

Impaired Balance 

Impaired Gas Exchange 

Knowledge Deficit RE: role of PT 



Clinical Impression/Prognosis: Pt is 62y/oM with B SDH s/p

evacuation and EVD placement p/w above impairments c/w

non-progressive d/o of the CNS.  He currently is most limited by

his impaired level of attention and cognition without evidence of

purposeful movement. He would most benefit from d/c to rehab with

multi disciplinary approach once medically stable to maximize his

functional mobility. Rehab prognosis to make gains and thus

progress to a 1 person assist with mobility and ADL's good given

the preservation of strength in *****/***** extremities and age, however

guarded given the length of time prior to surgery and patients

progressive past medical history

Radiology: 

*****/***** CTA Head:

1. Large right cerebral convexity mixed attenuation subdural

hematoma, causing sulcal effacement of the right frontal,

parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, 1.2 cm leftward midline

shift, effacement of the right lateral ventricle and right uncal

and subfalcine herniation. 2. No evidence of infarction. 

3. Near complete occlusion of the mid basilar artery with patent

distal run-off, likely secondary to atheromatous change. 

4. Atherosclerotic changes of the carotid bifurcations with 0%

right and at least 80 % left narrowing of the ICAs, by NASCET

criteria. 

5. Occlusion the right vertebral artery extending from its origin

up to its mid V2 segment.  Reconstitution of flow is seen

distally although diminutive, likely retrograde flow from the

contralateral side. 

6. 5 mm left upper lobe lung nodule. 



*****/***** Head CT:

1. Dental amalgam streak artifact limits study. 

2. Grossly stable size of large, acute on subacute right cerebral

convexity subdural hematoma.  Greatest diameter of the bleed

continues to measure 1.5 cm, similar compared to prior. 

3.  Approximately 1.4 cm of leftward midline shift, also similar

compared to prior. 

4. Complete effacement of right lateral ventricle is again seen

with suggestion of subfalcine and uncal herniation. 

5. Postsurgical changes related to patient's known interval right

middle meningeal artery embolization. 

6. No definite acute large territorial infarction. 

7. Right frontal and right pons probable chronic infarcts as

described. 



*****/***** Head CT:

1. Patient is now status post right-sided burr hole with

evacuation of acute on chronic subdural hematoma.  Mixed density

hematoma now measures 1.3 cm in greatest dimension, previously

1.5 cm.  There has been significant decrease in resultant

leftward midline shift, measuring 0.6 cm, previously 1.4 cm. 

Mass effect on right lateral ventricle is also markedly

decreased. 

2. Paranasal sinus disease, as above.  No definite acute, large

territorial infarction. 

3. Probable right pons chronic infarction is unchanged. 

4. Postsurgical changes in this patient status post right minimal

meningeal artery embolization. 



*****/***** CXR:

In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the tip of

the endotracheal tube lies approximately 2.8 cm above the carina.

There are slightly improved lung volumes.  Continued substantial

enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with possible mild

improvement in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The

retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm

is less prominent on the current study. 

The nasogastric tube again coils within the fundus of the stomach

with the tip projected close to the esophagogastric junction and

pointing upward toward it.

DIAGNOSIS 

Impairments of Body Functions and Structures, Activity

Limitations and Participation Restrictions

- Impaired attention/arousal/cognition 

- Impaired functional mobility  

- Impaired balance 

- Impaired strength

- Impaired ventilation  

- Impaired motor function 

- Knowledge deficit RE: post-SDH activity guidelines  



Clinical Impression/Prognosis: Pt is an ***** y/o F with a history

of aFib and R SDH who presents to physical therapy during ICU

stay for management of R SHD s/p burr hole and evacuation *****/*****. Pt

is functioning well below baseline limited by impairments in body

structure and function including decreased functional mobility,

cognition, motor function and cognition consistent with location

of bleed. Pt also presents with activity limitations in mobility

and self care contributing to difficulty in fulfilling societal

role of wife. Pt's AM-PAC t-scale score of <42.9 is consistent

with d/c to rehab. Pt will most benefit from discharge to

interdisciplinary rehabilitation to maximize functional mobility

and independence. Positive prognostic indicators include: ability

to isolate movement in *****/***** extremities, previous level of

function, and ability for spontaneous recovery. Potentially

limiting prognostic indicators include: age, presence of midline

shift. Acute PT will continue to follow and progress per plan of

care. 



Goals:               Time *****: 1 Week  

- Pt will maintain eyes open for 50% of PT session

- Pt will follow *****/***** single step commands

- Pt will answer *****/***** yes/no questions 

- Pt will sit at ***** with ***** from highback sling and overhead

lift



Goals:               Time *****: 2 weeks

- Pt will maintain eyes open for 75% of session

- Pt will roll with max *****

- Pt will follow *****/***** single step commands

- Pt will sit at ***** with max ***** x10 seconds with UE support 



Recommended Discharge: (x)rehab ( )home following  PT visits



Treatment Plan:  

Progress functional mobility including bed mobility, transfers,

as tolerated.

Balance training 

Cognitive activities and orientation training 

Pulmonary hygiene with continuous O2 monitoring 

Patient/Caregiver education RE: delirium reduction, early

mobility

D/C planning 



Frequency/Duration: 1-3x/week for 1 week



Recommendations for Nursing: 

Pt is at high risk for deconditioning please encourage frequent

mobility and maximize independence in *****.

Lift for all mobility including transfers to chair 3x/day.

Limit sitting time to one hour on pressure relieving air cushion

given patient's inability to effectively reposition in chair.

Please use chair alarm when out of bed.

Elevation of BUE on pillows for joint protection and minimize

edema.

Normalize sleep-wake cycle to decrease risk of delirium.



Patient agrees with the above goals and is willing to participate

in the rehabilitation program.  Please indicate with an 'X': Yes

( ) or No (x). If no please explain: pt unable at this time given

impaired cognition

Mr. ***** is a ***** yo gentleman who presented with L frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with no significant past medical history.    # ***** ***** intraparenchymal hemorrhage  Mr. *****'s intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) was felt secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). He had been found with aphasia and right sided weakness. He presented to ***** Hospital, where CT showed L-sided hemorrhage with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)/intraventricular extension, and he was transferred to ***** for further management. He was initially admitted to the *****, where an arterial line was placed. His first repeat CT scan demonstrated very mild expansion of the IPH, with minimal SAH expansion; the next repeat CT was stable. Final dimensions were 5.3 x 3.7cm.  Urine/serum toxicology screens were unremarkable. CTA was unremarkable of the intracranial vasculature, with no evidence of underlying vascular malformation. The suspicion given the location and the associated SAH was for CAA related bleed, although the differential 
included venous sinus thrombosis related bleed. An MRI/MRV brain was performed - while it was degraded by motion artifact, it confirmed the known intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and did not show any evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. Lipid panel revealed ***** 132, HDL 42, LDL 71, Trig 95, VLDL 19. Keppra was ordered initially but discontinued as the SAH was non-traumatic. His BP was managed as below. Eleven days after admission, the patient suffered an acute decline in mental status, in which he became ***** to sternal rub. A stat ***** ***** revealed new blood products and worsening edema as well as midline shift. He was given mannitol and transferred urgently back to the *****.    In the neuro ICU, he was put on maximal hyperosmolar therapy with mannitol and 23% hypertonic saline. He was taken down to the OR for left craniotomy for evacuation of his left-sided IPH. He was intubated for airway protection. Despite these measures, his serial head CTs continued to demonstrate worsening midline shift and larger amount of left subdural collection. His family was updated daily and were offered placement of another EVD and left subdural hematoma evacuation, however, they declined further surgical interventions. After a long discussion with family, they decided to make the patient comfortable. The etiology of his hemorrhage was thought to be likely amyloid.     # Hypertension  Initial SBP goal <140 for which he briefly required a nicardipine drip before liberalization to <160. Labetalol PO was started and uptitrated to 600mg BID. Captopril was also started, before being switched to Lisinopril.     # Postrenal Acute Kidney Injury  Precipitous increase in ***** from 0.78 to 3.84 around *****/*****. ***** placed with drainage of almost 1L urine immediately. Cr recovered to 0.77 within two days. ACE inhibitors held at the time.    # Fever / Urinary Tract Infection  Intermittently spiking fevers between *****/*****-*****/*****. 
Unclear etiology with low suspicion for infection driving fever - WBC remained normal (except for the day after PEG placement); CXR unremarkable; blood cultures with no growth. He did have enterococcus faecalis UTI for which he received Unasyn (*****/*****-*****/*****) then Fosfomycin (*****/*****-to continue until *****/*****); it was sensitive to both. He was also briefly broadened to Ceftazidime with concern for pulmonary source (*****/*****-*****/*****). The fevers were felt potentially secondary to drug reaction from ***** and less likely central cause.    # Incidental thyroid nodule   Left lobe thyroid gland nodule incidentally noted on ***** ***** Head.

Neurology Resident ***** *****



HPI

Mr. *****'***** is *****, h/o CVA (2013), AFib noncompliant on

dabigatran, DM, on multiple narcotic medications with unclear

compliance who was transferred to ***** from ***** for a 3 week

history of confusion in the setting of a traumatic left frontal

subdural hematoma. Neurology consulted after OSH MRI obtained by

primary team, suggestive of subacute stroke.



Per son, *****. *****'***** was at his baseline until 1 month ago which

is mild dysarthria and word finding difficulty as a result of his

prior stroke, but no other significant deficits and was

independent for all ADLs.  He had a ***** with ***** 3 weeks

ago and was subsequently evaluated at ***** found with new left

SDH, that was ultimately felt to be nonsurgical.  The timing of

this is not quite clear as OSH records from Portsmouth Hospital 2

weeks ago do not show apparently show the bleed.    Historical

details from the family and patient are also lacking.  What we do

know is that over the past month his family reports increased

confusion, word finding difficulty and ""not making sense,"" as

well as frequent falls.  This is a noticeable decline from his

usual baseline, as Mr. *****""***** is high functioning (retired

corporate executive). Family reports that he has also had 

decreased appetite with 10 pound weight loss and increased

somnolence since his head bleed.  Although there has been a

decline in function since 1 month ago, the family noted it was

worse in the past few days for unclear reasons.



The patient himself was not able to provide additional details.

At present the patient reports he is feeling ""much better.""

Denies any weakness, numbness, visual changes, dizziness or

headache. While he notices that he had trouble with memory and

concentration, he attributes these deficits to ""getting old"" and

feels that his primary need is physical rehabilitation.  Of note,

for 4-5 years has   also been struggling with back pain and

suspected abuse of multiple pain medications, including morphine,

tapentadol (*****) and buprenorphine patch (*****). One month

ago, around the beginning of the patient's recent decline, the

pt's wife took away his morphine because of suspected abuse.



Since arrival at ***** on *****/***** neurosurgery was consulted and

determined that his SDH is small without mass effect, unlikely to

explain his current symptomatology and does not require immediate

intervention. The team then obtained OSH records from *****

***** which showed concern for a subacute left *****

infarct.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

- Mental Status: Awake, alert, oriented x 3. Unable to provide

coherent history, stating vague dates of multiple ""strokes and

falls,"" although significantly improved on re-exam in the

morning. Inattentive of ***** forward, stopping in *****.

Attentive to ***** forward, but not backwards. On re-exam was

capable of *****. Speech is fluent, slightly dysarthric, with

intact comprehension, repetition and reading with rare phonemic

paraphasic errors (e.g. ""a hospital near my phone"" instead of

""home""). Naming intact to high and low frequency objects. On

memory testing, only registered *****/***** words after 2 trials, recall

is 1/4 at 5 minutes (*****/***** with choices). Was also unable to

Imaging:

DWI MRI from *****/***** shows a region of increased signal in left basal

ganglia/internal capsule. This same region is shows moderately

reduced signal on ADC. There is also increased signal on FLAIR in

the same region. This findings are consistent with a sub-acute

infarct, likely of 5-7 day duration prior to imaging on *****/*****.



NCHCT shows a thin band of increased intensity in the left

frontal region adjacent to the skull consistent with SDH.



ASSESSMENT:



Mr. *****'***** is a ***** h/o CVA (2013), IDDM, AFib noncompliant on

pradaxa and HTN presenting with altered mental status in the

setting of a left subdural hematoma, with new MRI findings

suggestive of an incidental subacute left ***** infarct.  

His exam is notable for improving attention, memory, mild

baseline dysarthria, otherwise with full strength, sensation, and

normal tone and coordination.  Labs show INR 1.0, normal

chemistry and CBC, no toxic-metabolic abnormality to account for

his symptoms.  Imaging obtained from ***** confirms a likely

subacute infarct, age most likely 4-7 days prior based on DWI+,

but ADC ***** from hypo to isointensity.  There is

also a known chronic appearing left frontal subdural but

otherwise without substantial atrophy.  



Differential for stroke etiology includes small vessel disease,

cardioembolic, *****.  Based on location and risk factors

we feel small vessel disease likely accounts for this, however

difficult to exclude cardioembolic phenomenon in the setting of

suspected noncompliance with pradaxa.  OSH echo was normal,

though.  ***** possible but unusual location for this and

recent OSH carotid US was without stenosis or plaque.  With

respect to question of anticoagulation going forward,  his

current CHADS2 risk score is 4, implying a 8.5% per year risk of

recurrent stroke.  It is reasonable to restart once out of the

acute SDH window, and he may benefit from switching to once daily

med like *****. 



With respect to his AMS, we think this is likely encephalopathy

of multifactorial etiology in the setting of multiple sedating

medications, ***** with *****/SDH, ETOH, dehydration,

possible delirium.  The infarct may be contributing to this

multifactorial picture but does not account for the mental status

on its own. 



PLAN:

- No further imaging at this time

- evaluate risk factors for recurrent stroke not previously

assessed including: HbA1c, lipids

- Dr. ***** to make attending-level decision regarding timing of

restarting anticoagulation in the setting of unknown SDH onset,

consider switching to ***** long-term as it is QD may be

preferable in the context of suspected medication non-adherence

- limit use of medications that may predispose to encephalopathy

- maintain regular sleep wake cycles 

- f/u with outpatient neurology (***** & van *****)

Addendum by ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** at 9:46 pm:

I saw ***** ***** *****, reviewed his recent head CT and prior

brain MRI, as well as Dr. *****'s note above. I agree with the

details of care mentioned in his note. I would like to add the

following comments: patient is a ***** year old man with a h/o AF,

previously on dabigatran and a prior stroke. States that he fell

3 weeks ago but unclear about the circumstances leading to *****.

Does not recall the ***** to the hospital. Found to have a

small SDH and taken off anticoagulation. A stroke consultation is

being sought to weigh in on the risks/benefit for starting

anticoagulation in light of recent SDH and a prior ischemic

stroke. On my exam, awake, oriented to date, locale. Attention

span is fair. Speech fluent with normal language functions. ST

recall *****/*****. No field cuts. Face symmetrical. Motor/sensory as

above. Gait: arises out of bed without assistance. Ambulates with

a fair stride length, mildly decreased arm swing and 2 point

turns. Tendency to retropulse on a pull tests.

Imp/Rec: Overall, patient is at an elevated risk of ischemic

stroke in light of his AF and a prior h/o stroke ( this

automatically increases his risk >10%/year). He has a small,

chronic appearing L- sided convexal SDH. He is at risk of falls

but this risk can be further mitigated by a careful PT evaluation

for gait safety and use or an assisting device. Overall the

risk/benefit seems to favor ***** anticoagulation. Suggest

starting on apixaban tonight and repeating a head CT in am.

He was on keppra ***** that was increased to ***** and the patient was discharged.       At 110PM today the patient had a seizure. His head deviated to the left, eyes open, shaking right hand. This lasted 20 seconds before stopping. The patient's wife gave 1mg PO ativan immediately. About 15 minutes later the same seizure happened and lasted 20 seconds.     The wife thinks that awareness was maintained but for reason gives that eyes were open and he was moving purposefully with the right upper extremity. He did not have tongue biting or incontinence.      In the ED the patient had two more seizures at around 340PM and again at 250 pm.  I observed the second from a distance. He turned his head to the left, eyes deviated to the left. During the episode the patient was moving the right arm in a non-rhythmic fashion. Left upper was obscured from my position.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    Dear ***** *****,    It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. As you are aware, you were admitted to the hospital for seizures. During your hospitalization, we performed several tests, including a CT scan of your head, which did not show worsening of the blood in your brain. To decrease your risk of additional seizures, a new seizure medication -- Vimpat -- was started and your home Keppra was continued.     There may be changes to your medications. Your new medication list is attached. It is important that you review all medication changes with your nurse before you leave.     We may have scheduled or referred you for follow-up appointment(s). Additional information can be found in this discharge packet. If you do not hear back about a ***** and Women's appointment, then please call (*****) *****-***** to schedule your appointment.    Please let us know if you have any questions.    Please return to the nearest Emergency Room if you experience fevers, confusion, seizures, loss of consciousness, falls, new weakness, new numbness, new slurred speech or new changes in your vision.    It was a pleasure taking care of you, and on behalf of the entire team at *****, we wish you all the best.

-Admission to Stroke Neurology.

-CTA/CTV to rule out underlying vascular lesion or sinus

thrombosis.

-MRI Brain +/- contrast to rule out underlying corpus callosum

lesion.

-Goal SBP <140.

-CBC, ***** 10, Coags.

-Neurosurgery will continue to follow. 





I have reviewed this case with Dr. ***** who formulated

the above plan.
