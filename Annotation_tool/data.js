The findings are reported below.\n\n\n\nNasal cavity:  Turbinate mucosa pink, moist; no drainage, pus or\n\npolyps \n\nNasopharynx:  Minimal residual adenoid tissue, no lesions or\n\nmasses, eustachian tube ***** patent, fossa of *****;\n\nappears normal\n\nOropharynx:  Symmetric soft palatal elevation, no masses or\n\nfullness in base of tongue\n\nHypopharynx:  No masses or lesions in vallecula, piriform\n\nsinuses, or post-cricoid area; no erythema; no pooling of\n\nsecretions\n\nLarynx:   Epiglottis non-edematous or erythematous. There is a\n\nsmall shallow ulcer (~3mm) along the laryngeal surface of the\n\nepiglottis likely secondary to prolonged intubation; ***** vocal\n\ncords symmetric. There are submillimeter bilateral vocal fold\n\ngranulomas along the posterior aspect of the vocal folds.

Per MD report, ***** due to\n\northostatic hypotension vs. mechanical ***** in setting of\n\ndementia, with toe amputation likely a contributing factor. Pt\n\nwithout LOC on most recent *****; however, staff and daughter\n\nnoticed change in behavior and mental status after a few hours.\n\n&#8203;Pt given Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and transferred\n\nto ***** for neurosurgical evaluation. Pt admitted to the *****\n\nwhere she received a unit of platelets; ICU stay complicated by\n\ndelirium, agitation, and orthostasis. Pt now transferred to\n\nmedicine service for management of delirium, IVF resuscitation\n\nfor orthostasis, and blood pressure. WBC counts are WNL. No CXR.\n\nMost recent head CT *****\/***** revealed stable large mixed-density\n\nright hemispheric subdural hematoma and stable leftward shift of\n\nmidline structures; no new hemorrhage.&#8203; We have been\n\nconsulted to r\/o aspiration when eating and drinking.\n\n\n\nPt has not been previously seen by our service. Pt is on a\n\nregular diet. Per RN report, pt has been tolerating diet, with\n\npills crushed or whole in applesauce. Per pt's granddaughter, pt\n\non a regular diet at baseline. Pt denied hx of dysphagia.\n\n\n\nEVALUATION:\n\nThe examination was performed while the patient was seated\n\nupright in the bed on ***** 11. Pt's granddaughter was present at\n\nthe bedside.\n\n\n\nCognition, language, speech, voice: Pt was awake and alert.\n\nOriented to name ***** *****. Not oriented to date (\"*****\"\n\nout of field of two, \"2013\" out of field of two). Pt's\n\ngranddaughter reported that pt is oriented x3 at baseline.\n\nExpressive and receptive language were grossly intact. Speech was\n\nintermittently unclear due to imprecise articulation and low\n\nvolume but grossly intelligible. Voice with mildly low volume but\n\nWNL.\n\nTeeth: Sparse natural dentition\n\nSecretions: Clear oral mucosa\n\n\n\nORAL MOTOR EXAM:\n\nTongue protruded midline. Lingual, labial, and buccal strength\n\nand ROM WNL. Palate elevated symmetrically. ***** deferred.\n\n\n\nSWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:\n\nPt offered PO trials of ice chips, thin liquids (tsp, cup),\n\npureed solids, ground solids, soft solids, and regular solids.\n\nOral phase was without anterior spillage or oral residue.\n\nMastication functional with rotary jaw movement despite sparse\n\nnatural dentition. Pharyngeal swallow triggered with palpable\n\nlaryngeal elevation. Pt was with light throat clearing after\n\ninitial ice chip. Pt was without other throat clearing, coughing,\n\nwet vocal quality, or O2 desats after all other trials. Pt denied\n\nsensation of aspiration or pharyngeal residue.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY \/ IMPRESSION:\n\nMs. ***** presents without overt s\/sx of aspiration after\n\nlarge volume of thin liquids. Recommend pt continue diet of thin\n\nliquids and regular solids, with pills crushed or whole in\n\napplesauce. As pt's granddaughter reported that pt is not at\n\ncognitive baseline, pt requires assistance with feeding and\n\nset-up during meals and should have meals only when fully alert\n\nand awake. Silent aspiration cannot be r\/o without a\n\nvideoswallow. We will sign off.

He was taken back to surgery emergently for evacuation of the epidural hematoma the same day, and subsequently transferred back to the ICU.  Despite subsequent imaging, the patient's neurologic exam did not improve and he remained intubated.  Given his poor neurologic exam, he was transitioned to comfort measures only on *****\/*****\/***** and terminally extubated.    Seizures:  The patient was placed on long term EEG monitoring on *****\/*****\/***** given persistent poor neurologic exam.  He was found to have seizures arising from the right temporal area.  He was started on anti-epileptics (renally dosed) and after his seizures were well-controlled, the EEG monitoring was discontinued on *****\/*****\/*****.    Heart failure:  An echocardiogram showed significant *****-atrial dilation with preserved ejection fraction.  The patient was treated with diuresis, diltiazem and metoprolol.  His home digoxin was held due to renal failure.    Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  The patient remained intubated throughout his hospitalization and was maintained on pressure support.  He was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for a ventilator-associated pneumonia.    Renal failure:  The patient developed acute renal failure during his hospitalization and was treated with Lasix, Bumex and metolazone during his stay to maintain urine output.

Our physicians and technologists are dedicated to providing highly skilled and compassionate care for you and your family. We understand that you may be apprehensive about your procedure. We hope that you will find the following information helpful as you prepare for the exam.  What should I expect BEFORE my CT scan? ***** When to arrive: You need to arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment. ***** Medications: It is important for you to keep your regular medication schedule. Please take all the medications that have been prescribed to you by your doctor and bring a list to your CT appointment. ***** Diabetic conditions: If you are an insulin-dependent diabetic, please continue to take your insulin as prescribed, but remember to drink extra fruit juices to make up for the fasting of solid foods for the 2 period that your \nstomach is empty. Patients who are taking diabetic medications should take the prescribed dose as normally done on that day. Patients should notify their Primary Care Physician (PCP) that they had contrast and were instructed to discontinue their medication for 48 hours. If you need a substitute medication, please consult your doctor. ***** Food and drink: You should not eat solid foods for two hours prior to your test. You may, however, drink plenty of fluids, such as water, broth, clear soups, juice, or black ***** coffee or tea. We encourage you to drink plenty of fluids before your arrival to our facility. ***** What to wear: You should dress in comfortable clothing. It might be necessary for you to change into a hospital gown if there is metal in your clothing, such as a ***** or *****, within the area of interest of your study. If you are wearing jewelry or anything else that might interfere with your scan, we will ask you to remove it. It is best that you leave your valuable items at home. ***** Intravenous preparation: Many patients receive a contrast agent intravenously (IV) during their CT test. If your doctor or the radiologist has determined that this procedure will enhance your CT scan results, the technologist will place an IV in your arm or hand prior to going into the exam.  During the Scan: You will meet the CT technologist when you are taken into the exam room. The technologist will explain everything that is happening. You will be helped onto the table, positioned correctly and may be secured by a strap which helps prevent you from moving. ***** slight movement blurs the x-rays.  The CT technologist controls the procedure in another room where they can still see and hear you. You will be moved slightly after each scan, although you may not notice the change. When the CT scan is complete, the technologist will make sure he or she has all the information the doctor will need. Your time in the CT scan room \nwill vary between 10 and 20 minutes per test depending on the procedure.  After your Scan: Once the technologist has all the images the physician requires, they will assist you off of the table. You are discharged immediately and you may resume your normal diet. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids for several days unless otherwise contraindicated. If you become constipated make sure you speak to the physician that ordered the test.  Contrast reactions happen rarely after leaving the hospital. However if you develop a skin rash, difficulty breathing or severe nausea or vomiting please contact your physician. If your symptoms are severe, call 911 or go to the closest emergency room.  The technologist cannot discuss results with you. The CT scan will be reviewed by a Radiologist and the results will be sent to the doctor who ordered your exam.

However, he had improved participation in the OT session, and was able to sustain arousal throughout. Could follow simple 1 step commands.   \u00a0  Per collateral obtained from the ED providers, it seems that the family was concerned about pt being less interactive today, and unable to participate in *****\/OT.

Intermittently oriented to person, place. No focal weakness noted on exam. Was trying to get out of bed frequently. Received ***** 5 mg x 1, and seroquel 25 mg (per prior d\/c med list). Had also received keppra 2000 mg IV x 1 ~1600, and 1500 mg at 2100.     =========================  Hospital course (by problem):  =========================  #Altered mental status  Pt has a very complex neuro history including right chronic SDH s\/p craniotomy for SDH evacuation (Dr. *****, *****\/*****\/*****) c\/b epilepsy with right-sided status epilepticus and breakthrough seizures (managed on keppra, previously also on valproic acid though this was discontinued iso thrombocytopenia on most recent admission) s\/p re-evacuation of SDH on *****\/*****\/*****, with recent admission to ***** (*****\/*****\/***** - *****\/*****\/*****) for traumatic 10mm R tentorial SDH, 5mm LF IPH, and scattered sulcal SAH. Now presenting from ***** with AMS. Per report, pt seemed less interactive, conversant, and less able to follow commands. On arrival, pt afebrile, ***** with sats in 90s on RA. BMP unremarkable. TSH WNL. Ammonia wnl. UA 1+ blood though otherwise negative. Urine culture preliminary results with rare (100 to <*****\/ml) Staph. CXR with hazy opacities in lung bases, though CT chest was without evidence of pneumonia. COVID-19 NP PCR negative. Low suspicion for meningitis given no meningismus. Has had urinary incontinence which suggests against urinary retention. Creatine WNL. CT head showed natural progression of pt's past intracranial hemorrhage, though no evidence of any acute changes. Repeat CT head (*****\/*****) was stable and without interval change when compared to initial CT head collected on *****\/*****. EEG (*****\/*****) with abundant to near continuous focal delta>theta slowing, and no epileptiform abnormalities presents which when compared with his EEG on (*****\/*****) showed no new significant changes. No leukocytosis. ***** was consulted, and recommended \nNeurology consult. Neurology was reassured by stable physical exam and head imaging and signed off with recommendation to continue keppra 1500mg BID. ***** recommended non-urgent MRI, though this was deferred given stable repeat CT head without new neurological changes. Given reassuring work-up, overall poor substrate, and recent discharge to unfamiliar environment the most likely etiology of his AMS is  hypoactive delirium. Further supporting hypoactive delirium is the waxing and waning mental status changes observed during his admission. On the day of discharge, the patient was largely alert, following commands, pleasant, and conversational. No new focal neurological deficits. In discussion with his daughter, his orientation has been persistently limited to self for several weeks prior to this admission. Recommended familiarity as much as possible -- having familiar objects and pictures at his bedside, calling, and visiting him as often as able. Pt will continue to work with PT and OT and should continue to follow-up routinely with ***** outpatient. A referral to Neuro-palliative was placed at discharge for optimized advance care planning. He was continued on his home keppra, seroquel, aricept, and melatonin at discharge.     #Seizures  Pt with hx of subdural hematoma s\/p craniotomy whose course was complicated by epilepsy with status epilepticus and breakthrough seizures for which he is on home Keppra. EEG this admission with no significant changes from prior one week prior. Per neurology, pt's Keppra is unlikely to be contributing to his principal presenting problem. Keppra level was pending at the time of discharge and he was continued on his home keppra dose of 1500mg BID per Neurology recommendations. Keppra level was pending at the time of discharge.  \u00a0  #Dysphagia  Pt has hx of dysphagia in setting of TBI s\/p fall from ladder in 2020. He presents this admission for concerns of AMS. CXR with hazy opacities in \nbilateral lung bases which could reflect aspiration vs developing pneumonia. On arrival, patient was placed on dysphagia diet with pureed food and mildly thick liquids. SLP was consulted to evaluate patient for advancement of diet as appropriate, and ultimately recommended soft\/bite sized with thin liquids and felt his evaluation was unchanged from recent evaluation on prior hospitalizations. *****, ***** chest did not show evidence of any pneumonia.  \u00a0  #Hyperlipidemia  Atorvastatin that was initially held in the setting of elevated transaminases which has since resolved. Atorvastatin was restarted with normalization of LFTs.   \u00a0  #Transaminitis  Pt initially presented for AMS found to have mildly elevated transaminases (ALT 62, AST 53, ***** 115) on arrival. Pt's home Atorvastatin was held, and hepatitis serologies were ordered in this setting though unremarkable. Subsequent LFTs showed downtrending ALT 47, AST 32, ***** 70. Atorvastatin was restarted and RUQUS cancelled.   \u00a0  #Hypertension  Continued lopressor 12.5mg BID.       Medications   Allergies: Patient has no known allergies.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    =========================  While you were in the hospital:  =========================  You came to the Emergency Department because your family was concerned that you had a change in mental status.    While you were at the hospital, you did not know where you were, or what month\/year it was so we did the following:    - You had some blood drawn for a broad laboratory workup. These came back normal aside from you liver function labs, which were slightly elevated. *****, these returned back to normal without intervention.     - You had a CT scan of your head, where they did not find any new bleeding or swelling in or around your brain. You were evaluated by both Neurology and Neuro-Surgery who recommended continuation of your medications. They were reassured by your stable imaging and your negative infectious work-up.    - You were confused while admitted and became a bit aggressive with the staff, so we had you in soft wrist restraints for your safety and the staff's. This improved and your restraints were \nremoved.     - We think your altered mental status is attributable to \"delerium.\" This is confusion that waxes and wanes. You may seem tired and confused sometimes, but alert and more oriented at other times. You are at high risk of delirium because of your extensive neurological history, your recent hospitalizations, and your unfamiliar environment at the rehab facility. We recommend that you surround yourself with familiarity, and we spoke with your daughter ***** about getting familiar objects to put at your bedside, and printing out pictures for you to look at.     =====================================  When you leave the hospital, we recommend:  =====================================  - Please follow up with your primary care provider and any specialists who you see for ongoing outpatient care. Your scheduled appointments are included in this discharge paperwork. It is very important that you go to any scheduled appointments. If, for any reason, you cannot make it to your appointments please call that office to let them know so they can reschedule you appropriately.    - It is very important that you carefully review your ***** medication list, paying special attention to new medications and medications you have been instructed to stop. Take all your medications as they are prescribed to you.     - A healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is a great way to support overall health.

She\n\nlives alone in assisted living, with home services for much of\n\nthe day, but per family, often ambulates independently.

She has had multiple\n\nrecent falls with injuries, and has poor safety awareness leading\n\nto impulsive movements.  It does not appear that there is other\n\ncause of her recurrent falls, although she may have a UTI, though\n\nnot clear that that caused these falls..  Safe discharge planning\n\nwill need to include her family to determine best options at this\n\npoint, given her poor experience previously with rehab, but the\n\nclear lack of safety at home.\n\n\n\nFrequent falls, with distal radius fracture, SDH, greater\n\ntrochanter fracture - agree with PT, pain control prn and *****\n\nprecautions.\n\n\n\nPossible UTI - follow up cultures - and ctx reasonable.\n\n\n\nAtrial fibrillation - by report - risk of anticoagulation with\n\nold bleed, and *****, clearly ***** any benefit of\n\nanticoagulation.\n\n\n\nDementia, possible acute delirium, *****'s - supportive care\n\n\n\nDisposition - either today or tomorrow - will need to discuss\n\nnext steps with family and HCP - given clear failure with home\n\ndischarge, and need for either 24 hour care or rehabilitation. \n\nHer current lack of weight bearing with her left arm likely makes\n\na home discharge unlikely at this point.

He was recently admitted to ***** for hematochezia secondary to hemorrhoids with course complicated by urinary retention thought secondary to BPH for which a foley was placed with plan for outpatient urology follow-up. Per VNA at beside, prior to this admission patient was able to ambulate and have a conversation. After discharge on *****\/*****, however, he did not fully return to ***** ***** baseline. He spent most of the day in a chair or in bed, and was less talkative. Given this change in mental status, his primary care doctor ordered a UA which was inflammatory with pyuria, concerning for UTI for which he was prescribed a course of ciprofloxacin starting *****\/*****; culture grew MSSA and pan-susceptible E. Coli. Despite antibiotics, his mental status worsened and symptoms progressed such that he stopped eating so EMS was called. Of note, patient suffered ***** out of bed on *****\/*****\/*****. He has also been complaining of left leg pain for past several weeks with recent x-ray of femur showing mixed sclerotic and lucent changes (favored to be infarct and less likely *****'s disease) as well as swelling thought secondary to venous insufficieny (negative ***** *****\/*****\/*****, normal biventricular function on TTE *****\/*****\/*****).           ED Course:    On presentation to ED, vitals notable for tachycardia to 115 and hypoxemia requiring 4L via nasal cannula. Initial labs notable for leukocytosis to 13 and PT-INR 1.6. CT head showed 3 mm left frontoparietal subdural hematoma. CT-PE chest revealed RUL pulmonary embolism, new RLL dense consolidation and acute fracture of right clavicle and left eight rib. CT abdomen\/pelvis revealed no acute findings with unchanged severe L1 compression \nfracture. ***** was consulted and recommended holding anticoagulation given high risk of re-bleeding. He also received on dose of IV vitamin *****. ***** team was in agreement with holding anticoagulation. Trauma was consulted for fractures. He was started on cefepime\/***** with notable fever to 101.8 this AM. Blood cultures drawn on presentation are NGTD, UA was inflammatory with pyuria (20-50).                 =========================  Hospital course (by problem):  =========================    #Goals of Care Discussion  The patient has had a long medical course as described below with admission in beginning of ***** and he has not returned to his baseline after that admission. He has now returned for SDH, multiple fractures, PE and DVT. The patient has become weaker and AMS worsening with more sedation and loss of appetite. Spoke to HCP ***** who voiced the same concern that patient has not returned to his baseline in early ***** after the first admission. He was concerned that the patient has loss his will to eat and is refusing medications. He knows the patient well for over 40 years and knows that he would not want any surgeries or heroic measures to be taken. He knows that the patient would want to pass away at home and would be more comfortable at home. He elected to consult palliative care and home hospice. The home hospice team has been in discussions with him regarding dropping off supplies at his house and plan for discharge home. Discussed stopping unnecessary medications and PO medications because he is refusing to take medications. AED medications are oral and patient will not be able to take so home hospice team recommended using Rectal Diazepam PRN and SL Lorazepam 1mg Q6hours. ***** placed *****\/***** and will stay in indefinitely for comfort. Stopping Tamsulosin. Tylenol PR, Lidocaine patches, and Voltaren Gel for pain control. Home hospice team can add oral morphine if patient appears to be in pain but \ncurrently he does not appear in pain. ***** completed a ***** form over the phone and signed by witness.     #Altered mental status  At baseline, the patient reportedly able to ambulate, have a conversation, and feed himself. Never returned to prior baseline after most recent hospitalization (discharged *****\/*****\/*****) -- immobile, and less engaged. In the days PTA, he developed worsening altered mental status and was obtunded on presentation. Likely multifactorial etiology including toxic metabolic encephalopathy from infections, electrolyte derangement, and possibly from small SDH, all superimposed on poor substrate given severe underlying dementia. There was low concern for breakthrough seizure based on exam and lactate WNL. Unlikely meningitis given reassuring exam without meningismus. Mental status initially improved with treatment of infection but then it worsened and patient stopped eating and drinking. He refused PO medications. GOC discussion as above and elected for referral for home hospice.       #Aspiration pneumonia  WBC 13.9k on ***** ***** *****-PE showing dense consolidation in ***** and multifocal nodular opacities concerning for aspiration pneumonia. Suspect recurrent aspiration event as his WBC rose substantially to 38.3k within 12 hours and he had increased oxygen requirement to 3L NC. He was started empirically on vanc\/zosyn (*****\/***** - *****\/*****), unable to produce a sputum given AMS. MRSA swab negative, transitioned to CTX\/flagyl (*****\/***** - *****\/*****), though Flagyl was discontinued on *****\/*****. His HH aide observed increased difficulty swallowing at home. SLP recommended pureed diet with mildly thick liquids with meds crushed in puree and 1:1 supervision with feeds. Diet was kept palliative at discharge. He can eat puree and mild thick liquids but eating is for comfort and enjoyment.       #Urinary tract infection  #***** catheter in place  Developed urinary retention during his most recent hospitalization, thought \nsecondary to immobility, and was discharged with a ***** in place on *****\/***** with a plan for outpatient follow-up with Urology. Given ongoing confusion, a UA was sent outpatient and urine culture grew abundant MSSA and Ecoli, for which he was prescribed a course of cipro starting *****\/*****. UA this admission remained c\/w infection, and repeat urine culture grew few MSSA. CT abdomen\/pelvis without concern for pyelonephritis. ***** exchanged *****\/*****\/*****. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics given concern for septic infection, likely from aspiration pneumonia, and therefore cipro was discontinued. He received adequate treatment for UTI with Vanc\/zosyn (*****\/*****-*****\/*****) followed by CTX (*****\/***** - *****\/*****). He was started on Flomax on *****\/*****, foley was exchanged on *****\/***** secondary to *****, and then he underwent a void trial on *****\/***** which was unsuccessful and he needed foley replaced on *****\/*****. He only produced 415cc of urine in the 24 hour period and was unable to void it. This demonstrated how dehydrated he had been from not eating or drinking.      #Subdural hematoma  Incidentally found to have new SDH (3 mm) on CT head likely from recent ***** at home. Repeat CT done for stability 6 hours later with stable SDH (4 mm). ***** consulted, recommended repeat CTH in 1 week, which showed no interval increase in ***** and no new intracranial bleeds. Thorough discussion was had with *****, *****, about risks and benefits of leaving IVC filter in place vs starting on oral anticoagulation. Because ***** is such a high bleed risk, his HCP opted to leave IVC filter in place indefinitely, understanding the risks associated with doing so.    #VTE (venous thromboembolism)  #Pulmonary embolism  #Multiple deep vein thromboses  Decreased mobility since at least *****\/*****\/***** due to severe left leg pain, then essentially bed-bound since recent discharge on *****\/*****\/*****. On admission he was tachycardic and hypoxic, with CT PE (*****\/*****) showing PE in ***** \npulmonary artery. ***** flat. No RV strain on CT. Given small SDH, ***** team recommended against initiation of AC particularly given risk of re-bleeding and concomitant coagulopathy with INR 1.6. They recommended repeat CTH in 1 week, which showed no interval increase in ***** and no new intracranial bleeds Given his history of large SDH requiring evacuation, recent ***** *****\/***** hemorrhoids, diverticular bleed (2020), and high risk of falls the decision was made to defer anticoagulation after thorough discussion of risks\/benefits with HCP. The ***** team was consulted and recommended *****, which showed multiple DVTs (RLE: popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal; LLE: peroneal). IVC filter placed *****\/*****, with recommendation to remove as soon as AC can be safely initiated, though also noted it could be left in indefinitely though with some associated risks.      #Fractures  Found to have acute clavicular fracture, left eighth rib fracture, and severe L1 compression fracture with reported fall from standing on *****\/*****\/*****. Ortho Trauma and Trauma Surgery consulted in ED with recommendation for conservative management including sling for comfort, multimodal pain regimen, and incentive spirometry. Previously prescribed alendronate for several years, most recent DEXA (*****\/*****) showing osteopenia. Fracture ***** consulted who recommended cholecalciferol 2000 IU QD, calcium carbonate 500mg elemental calcium BID, and zoledronic acid 5mg IV x1 (*****\/*****). Recommend follow-up with Endocrine Associates or with Rheumatology for continued bone health if his goals of care change.      #Left leg pain  Patient with debilitating left leg pain and swelling starting ~*****\/*****, significantly limiting mobility, was being worked-up by his PCP prior to admission. Outpatient work-up included TTE (*****\/*****) with LVEF 71% and normal biventricular function. ***** (*****\/*****) negative for DVT. Left hip and femur XR without fracture or other acute change compared to \n2020 films. This admission, L knee XR shows chondrocalcinosis. Rheum consulted, s\/p L knee arthrocentesis (*****\/*****) which did now show evidence of crystals and given the fact patient was largely bed bound a corticosteroid injection was deferred. Suspect multiple new DVTs in his left leg are also contributing. Pain managed adequately. PT recommended inpatient rehab.    #Dementia  Alzheimer's dementia requiring 24\/7 care though, per VNA at bedside, patient is able to ambulate and have a conversation at baseline. Oriented to self only. Given AMS, he was initially unable to take home medications for dementia. Continued home donepezil and memantine until the patient started not eating and refusing medications. At this time, Donepezil and Namenda will not be helpful because of end-stage Dementia.       #Seizure disorder  Seizure disorder, chronically on phenobarbital 21.4 mg TID and phenytoin 100 mg QID. Given AMS, patient not able to tolerate PO meds, so AED transitioned to IV phenobarbital 32.4mg TID, and IV fosphenytoin 100mg until mental status improved and orals could be reinitiated. Phenytoin level 19.2 on *****\/*****. The patient was not taking PO medications upon discharge so he was convert to Ativan SL liquid 1mg Q6 hours and Rectal Diazepam 15mg PRN for active seizure.        #Abnormal LFTs  CT A&P without explanation for elevated LFTs. Abd US without hepatic lesions or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. Mild prominence of CBD, though likely post-***** related. Suspect ***** vs shock liver from hypotension in the ED. LFTs improved and returned to WNL without intervention.    #AKI  Baseline 0.6-0.7, peaked at ~1.5, suspect ATN iso sepsis. Cr on discharge 0.45. The patient continued to be dehydrated from not eating and drinking so labs were stopped for palliative care.      #Diarrhea  Loose stool noted on presentation to ED. Cdiff negative. Stool culture negative for enteric pathogens, +mod yeast. ***** negative. CT AP \nwith extensive sigmoid diverticulosis which could be contributing, atop of recent decreased nutritional intake and IV antibiotics\/underlying infection. ***** abdominal exam was benign, without pain, rebound tenderness, or distention and loose stools resolved.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    =========================  While you were in the hospital:  =========================  - You came to the hospital for altered mental status. You were found to have a urinary tract infection and an aspiration pneumonia. You were treated with IV antibiotics for your infection.    - You were found to have a small collection of blood in your subdural space in your head. You were evaluated by the Neurosurgery Team who recommended surveillance CT scans to monitor this bleed. These scans showed no interval increase in the size of the bleed and no new bleeds.     - You were also found to have a blood clot in your lungs (called a pulmonary embolism). The standard treatment for blood clots is a \nblood thinner, but due to the bleeding in your head and your history of GI bleeds and chronic bleeding in your head you were not considered to be a safe candidate for a blood thinner. Our Vascular Medicine Team evaluated you and recommended ultrasounds of your legs to look for deep vein clots. You were found to have several clots in the deep veins of your legs (where clots are most likely to form). You had a filter placed in one of the large veins that leads to your heart to catch any of the clots that might break up and try to travel to ***** *****. It was elected to keep the IVC filter in place indefinitely rather than starting blood thinning medications because you have a high risk of bleeding on blood thinners.      - You had several fractures noted on your imaging including of your collar bone, your ribs, and of one of your vertebrae. The Fracture ***** service evaluated you and recommended supplemental vitamin D and an IV medication to help your bones get stronger in the hope that this will prevent future fractures.    - Due to your altered mental status, you were initially unable to take oral medications safely. Your seizure medications were changed to IV formulation. You were not taking oral pills well so your seizure medication was changed to Ativan 1mg liquid to be given Sub-lingual every 6 hours. The home hospice team will fill prescription for Valium to be given in case of a seizure as rectal suppository.      - You were discharged with a ***** on your most recent admission. This admission your ***** was removed but you were unable to urinate so it was replaced.     - You were evaluated by the Speech and ***** Team who recommended a modified diet to prevent aspiration: pureed solids and mildly thick liquids.    - Your long hospital stay and previous hospital stay took a large toll on your mental status and you stopped eating or drinking and you were refusing medications. After discussion with your \nhealth care proxy *****, it was determined that you would not have wanted heroic measures to be taken and instead would have elected for palliative care. Your unnecessary medications were discontinued and other medications converted to rectal or sublingual formulations so you can still receive them for palliative measures. Home Hospice consulted and you were set up with home services to make you comfortable at home.    =====================================  When you leave the hospital, we recommend:  =====================================  - Please follow up with Home Hospice for ongoing care and home services. The goal of your care now is to keep you comfortable and keep you at home.      - It is very important that you carefully review your ***** medication list, paying special attention to new medications and medications you have been instructed to stop. Take all your medications as they are prescribed to you.

They parted ways and then pt was found down. Initially thought to just be EtOH but EMS was called and was concerned for assault so pt brought to *****.   \u00a0  At ***** ***** reportedly further declined requiring intubation. NCHCT at ***** reportedly showed hyperdensity at the sagittal sinus with scattered ***** and nondisplaced skull fracture. Repeat NCHCT reportedly stable.  \u00a0  After transfer pt had repeat NCHCT and also MRI\/MRV which showed likely venous epidural hemorrhage and patent venous sinuses. Admitted to neuro-ICU.    ---------------------------------------  Hospital Course by Problem  ---------------------------------------  # Epidural hemorrhage  The presumed mechanism of injury was trauma, likely due to strike at the vertex with a blunt object. MRV was negative for venous sinus thrombosis and the patient's intracranial hemorrhage was stable on serial imaging over 8 hours. Thought to likely be venous hemorrhage given stability of bleed. His SBP goal was maintained as <140 for 24 hours then liberalized to <160. With liberalization to <160 pt did not require PO anti-HTN medication. Plan to f\/u in ***** clinic as outpatient.     # Concern for seizure  Given the patient's neurological status on presentation, he was loaded with keppra 2g and continued on keppra 1g BID. He was also placed on LTM, which was unremarkable. Plan to continue keppra for 7 days only given unclear if pt had seizure, and if he did it would have clearly been provoked. Normal EEG reassuring. Keppra for 7d completed prior to discharge.    # Substance use  The patient's EtOH level upon arrival to ***** was 188, and so he was started on thiamine, folate, and MVI and monitored for withdrawal, with the plan being to start a phenobarbital taper vs CIWA if he started to demonstrate signs and symptoms of withdrawal. \nAlso with +cocaine on UTox. Addiction medicine was consulted.    # Found down  The patient had a C collar placed. Upon initial attempt to clear the collar clinically, the patient endorsed pain upon neck flexion, and so it was continued. Repeat attempt to clear the collar clinically unsuccessful given persistent pain. Plan to try again *****\/***** and if still having pain will pursue MRI C-Spine. The patient's CK was initially 850, and so he was hydrated with IVF and ***** ***** down to 323. ***** *****-***** on *****\/***** was normal so C-collar was removed    # Respiratory failure  The patient was intubated due to concern for airway protection. At *****, he was doing well on minimal ventilator settings and was following commands briskly, even through sedation. As such, he was extubated *****, swiftly converted to room air.    #Hyponatremia  Just prior to discharge his sodium was downtrending. We tried an IV bolus of fluids with decline in ***** to 130 therefore etiology more likely SIADH than hypovolemia. He was placed on fluid restriction and given salt tabs.     #Pain  From his trauma, patient was experiencing pain and headache. He received tylenol but also required *****-***** doses of PRN oxycodone or dilaudid. He was discharged on a small amount to continue taking at home.

You were monitored closely by Neurology and Neurosurgery and did not require any surgical intervention. You had an MRI of \nyour cervical spine which was normal. You were evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy and greatly improved in your function, but will need more time to recover. We recommend you discuss ways to address your substance use with your PCP.    We have scheduled you an appointment with ***** *****, Dr. ***** *****, on ***** ***** at 10:45AM (can reschedule at *****-*****-*****). Please attend this appointment to re-establish care.    You will be discharged on Dilaudid for pain control. This medication can make you constipated so you can take Miralax (an over the counter medication).   Your salt level was low which is a result of your injury. You will need to take salt tabs three times a day, your PCP will help you wean this over time. You should also restrict what you drink to no more than 1500 ml per day. If you are drinking fluids, it is better to drink fluids with electrolytes (e.g. Gatorade, smart water, crystal light).

Allowing for differences in technique, left cerebral convexity\n\nsubdural hematoma is grossly unchanged, measuring up to 1.2 cm in\n\nthickness. No areas of layering or contrast extravasation to\n\nsuggest active bleeding. \n\n2. There is similar partial effacement of the bilateral lateral\n\nventricles.  Increased rightward midline shift, previously\n\nmeasuring up to 6 mm, now up to 10 mm, is more than expected for\n\ndifferences in positioning, and is nonspecific in the absence of\n\na growing hematoma. Subtle diffuse loss of gray-white matter\n\ndifferentiation throughout the left cerebral hemisphere may \n\nsuggest cerebral edema. No definite acute large territory\n\ninfarction or frank obstructing hydrocephalus. If indicated, MR\n\nmay be obtained to better evaluate an underlying cause. \n\n\n\nCTA Head and Neck: \n\n  \n\n1. No flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm greater than\n\n3 mm within the circle of ***** and its principal intracranial\n\nbranches. No active extravasation within the left subdural\n\nhematoma. \n\n2. No flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or dissection within the\n\nmajor arteries of the neck. \n\n3. The dural venous sinuses are patent. \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT:\n\n===========\n\n\n\n***** is a ***** year old man with recent spontaneous SDH while on\n\neliquis for afib who presented to ED for word-finding difficulty,\n\n*****, with findings of new 10mm MLS on NCHCT but without\n\nsignificant increase in *****. Of note, current symptoms on\n\npresentation slightly different from prior symptoms, as he had\n\nleft numbness and left ***** at that time but did not have word\n\nfinding difficulty. \n\n\n\nHis exam is notable for lethargy with some word-finding\n\ndifficulty \n\n\n\nI am concerned about the possibility that he may have suffered an\n\nembolic stroke while being off anti-coagulation as the edema on\n\nhis NCHCT appears out of proportion to SDH. Alternatively, he may\n\nhave had an unwitnessed seizure or have subclinical seizures in\n\nsetting of worsening midline shift. Admission is warranted for\n\nintervention as well as further evaluation of edema focus seen on\n\nNCHCT resulting in midline shift.\n\n\n\nThe etiology of his non-traumatic SDH was thought to be eliquis\n\nalthough ongoing work-up is still pending. His SDH is now >5 mm\n\nwith >10mm of mls suggesting he may benefit from surgical\n\nintervention.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- agree with admission to neurosurgical service\n\n- neurology will follow as consulting service\n\n- continue keppra as prescribed\n\n- consider MRI brain to r\/o infarct\n\n- if speech arrests continue, could consider cvEEG\n\n\n\nPatient discussed with Chief Resident Dr. *****.\n\n\n\n***** *****, MD PhD\n\n*****, Neurology\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum by ***** *****. *****, MD on *****\/*****\/***** at 5:05 pm:\n\nAgree with above. On exam today patient had difficulty with\n\nspeech with fluency issues though relatively intact naming,\n\nassociated dysarthria and speech hesitancy. He was able to\n\ncomplete the rest of my neurological exam which was non-focal\n\nexcept for speech issues as above and oral-motor incoordination\n\n(when asked to stick out tongue would purse lips etc.).  \n\n\n\nGiven he is planned for the OR tomorrow, MRI and cvEEG are not\n\nnecessary at this time.  If he has ongoing speech arrest\n\npost-operatively though or his post-op head CT is concerning for\n\nongoing edema etc. out of proportion to expected SDH would\n\nrecommend MRI and cvEEG at that time. Given he is able to\n\ncomplete the entire rest of my exam today, suspect that his\n\nspeech arrest issues are more related to irritability at the site\n\nof his SDH rather than true seizures. In addition, a stroke\n\nsecondary to the hemorrhage would likely be secondary to pressure\n\neffects on local blood vessels and surgery to remove the SDH\n\nshould help.  That being said, the edema on my read of the CT\n\ndoesn't seem out of proportion for the amount of SDH.\n\n\n\nHowever, given his anticoagulation and anti-platelets are being\n\nheld he is at risk for a stroke, and any new additional\n\nneurological exam findings would warrant consideration of head\n\nimaging (CT vs. MRI) to look for a new stroke vs. expansion of\n\nthe hemorrhage. \n\n\n\n***** continue to follow along with you. \n\n\n\n***** *****, MD\n\nNeurology Consults Attending\n\n\n\nWe have spent 70 minutes face to face, greater than 50% of which\n\nwas spent reviewing history, medications, function, goals,\n\neducation, counseling, coordinating care.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety.\u00a0Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are\u00a0having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  Taking care of yourself  You may get dizzy if you do not drink enough water. To prevent dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, enough so that your urine is light yellow or clear like water. Choose water and other caffeine-free clear liquids. If you have kidney, heart, or liver disease and have to limit fluids, talk with your doctor before you increase the amount of fluids you drink.  Exercise regularly to improve your strength, muscle tone, and balance. Walk if you can. Swimming may be a good choice if you cannot walk easily.  Have your vision and hearing checked each year or any time you notice a change. If you have trouble seeing and hearing, you might not be able to avoid objects and could lose your balance.  Know the side effects of the medicines you take. Ask your doctor or pharmacist whether the medicines you take can affect your balance. Sleeping pills or sedatives can affect your balance.  Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Alcohol can impair your balance and other senses.  Ask your doctor whether calluses or ***** on your feet need to be removed. If you wear \nloose-fitting shoes because of calluses or *****, you can lose your balance and *****.  Talk to your doctor if you have numbness in your feet.  Preventing falls at home  Remove raised doorway thresholds, ***** rugs, and *****. Repair loose carpet or raised areas in the floor.  Move furniture and electrical cords to keep them out of walking paths.  Use nonskid floor wax, and wipe up spills right away, especially on ceramic tile floors.  If you use a walker or cane, put rubber tips on it. If you use crutches, clean the ***** of them regularly with an abrasive pad, such as ***** wool.  Keep your house well lit, especially *****, *****, and outside *****. Use night-lights in areas such as ***** and bathrooms. Add extra light switches or use remote switches (such as switches that go on or off when you clap your hands) to make it easier to turn lights on if you have to get up during the night.  Install ***** ***** on *****.  Move items in your cabinets so that the things you use a lot are on the lower shelves (about waist level).  Keep a cordless phone and a flashlight with new batteries by your bed. If possible, put a phone in each of the main rooms of your house, or carry a cell phone in case you ***** and cannot reach a phone. Or, you can wear a device around your neck or wrist. You push a button that sends a signal for help.  Wear low-heeled shoes that fit well and give your feet good support. Use footwear with nonskid soles. Check the heels and soles of your shoes for wear. Repair or replace worn heels or soles.  Do not wear socks without shoes on wood floors.  Walk on the ***** when the ***** are slippery. If you live in ***** ***** that gets snow and ice in the *****, ***** salt on slippery steps and *****.  Preventing falls in the bath  Install grab bars and nonskid ***** inside and outside your shower or tub and near the toilet and *****.  Use shower chairs and bath benches.  Use a \nhand-held shower head that will allow you to sit while showering.  Get into a tub or shower by putting the weaker leg in first. Get out of a tub or shower with your strong side first.  Repair loose toilet ***** and consider installing a raised toilet seat to make getting on and off the toilet easier.  Keep your bathroom door unlocked while you are in the shower.

Patient had was recently found to have SDH in the setting of frequent falls, though repeat CT demonstrated acute on chronic appearance and stable size without any mass effect. Given this known SDH, patient's AMS was initially concerning for seizure secondary to SDH and\/or post-ictal confusion. However, given his prompt improvement in mental status after Sinemet, it seemed overall likely that patient has been ***** on Sinemet, which is consistent ***** outpatient neurologist's report that his regimen at nursing home has been lower than his prior doses. In addition, given his recorded fevers, metabolic encephalopathy is also considered, though the fever could be due to his DVT and so far infectious work up is negative without leukocytosis and electrolytes are within normal limits (see # Fever below). Other ***** that were considered and deemed unlikely were cardiac arrhythmia that he last presented with, though now s\/p pacemaker or orthostatic hypotension. Per discussion with outpatient neurologist Dr. *****'s impression that patient was *****, patient was restarted on his prior Sinemet dose per his recommendation (Sinemet\u00a0*****\/***** 1 tablet at 9AM, 1 tablet at 1PM, 2 tabs at 5PM, 1 tablet 9PM). In addition, previous treatment plan was to optimize his Seroquel dosing to address his hallucination with the hope that it will allow for more Sinemet dosing. As such, patient was gradually restarted on home Seroquel 25mg at 6pm and 12.5gm at 9am, as his mental status improved avoid worsening hallucination. For his orthostatic hypotension, patient was continued on home midodrine 10mg\u00a0daily\u00a0at 9am + 5mg BID\u00a0at 12pm and 4pm and fludrocortisone 0.2mg at 9am. Although there was initially concerns for dysphagia and aspiration leading to NGT placement, patient's swallowing mechanics improved to baseline \nupon Sinemet administration, and SLP cleared him to regular diet and thin liquid that he was on previously. Spot EEG did not show epileptiform activity so seizure was thought to be unlikely, and Keppra was discontinued. Given his improved mental status on Sinemet uptitration, patient was discharged back to *****. At the time of discharge, his final regiment was Sinemet\u00a0*****\/***** 2.5 tablets at 8AM, 2.5 tablets at 12 noon, 3 tablets at ***** ***** and 2 tablets at 8PM. Patient was scheduled to follow up with his outpatient neurologist on ***** *****.    # AoC\u00a0SDH  As explained above, patient was found to have SDH on ***** ***** after a *****. Repeat CT scan demonstrated stable acute on chronic SDH. Neurosurgery who evaluated him in the ED deferred any surgical intervention and recommended holding home apixaban 5mg BID was held for two weeks (until *****\/*****) due to his SDH. Patient was scheduled to receive a repeat CT head on *****\/***** on the same day he was scheduled with his outpatient neurologist, after which the decision to restart ***** will be made by his provider.  \u00a0  # RLE DVT  # Fever without leukocytosis  Initially based on his recorded fever, there were concerns that possible infectious etiologies were contributing to his toxic metabolic picture, though no clear source of infection found. UA with RBC (I\/s\/o foley) without LE\/nitrite. CBC without leukocytosis. COVID negative. CXR without any evidence of PNA. Given his history of DVT\/PE (though was on apixaban), ***** was obtained, which demonstrated LLE DVT. However, given given SDH and distal DVT that is less likely to embolize to cause PE, home apixaban continued to be held for two weeks two weeks (until *****\/*****) with plan to restart apixaban after ***** ***** once repeat CT head is obtained to ensure that SDH has been stabilized.     # Afib  # Cardiac arrhythmia s\/p pacemaker  As explained above per #AoC SDH, home apixaban was held for two weeks (until *****\/*****) with plan to restart \nonce SDH has been stabilized. Patient was noted to have Afib with RVR to 120s, for which he was briefly on metop tartrate 6.25 *****, but HR promptly stabilized during the hospitalization without any need for beta blocker.     # GOC discussion  Per daughter who is his HCP, patient remained full code confirmed. Outpatient neurologist also confirmed full code for now after discussing with patient himself. However, HCP was under-informed about his long-term prognosis and was equivocal about making any medical decisions regarding his code. As such, his outpatient neurologist offered to lead GOC with daughter.   \u00a0  Chronic stable problem:  # Hyperlipidemia: continue home rosuvastatin 10mg   # Dry eye: continue home timolol and ***** drop  # Insomnia:\u00a0continue home\u00a0mirtazapine and continue melatonin PRN       Medications   Allergies: Patient has no known allergies.

On examination, the patient has some inattention and\n\ndifficulty with ordering, however, her reported global aphasia\n\nhas improved significantly to the point where she has no\n\ndifficulty naming high or low frequency items.  Her reported\n\nweakness in the right arm has resolved completely with no\n\ndistribution demonstrating anything but full strength.  Given her\n\nreported symptoms, it is highly likely that the patient\n\nexperienced a provoked seizure due to left cortical irritation\n\nresulting in likely complex partial focal motor convulsions in\n\nthe right hemibody which may have secondarily generalized.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    POST CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY (MMA) EMBOLIZATION ORDERS:  There is no need to keep the puncture site covered.   No heavy lifting (10 pounds) or straining for two weeks after the procedure.   No straining, lifting or activity that puts increased pressure on the area that is healing.   You should wait at least 5 days before resuming exercise.  Do not take baths or go swimming for at least 5 days after the angiogram.    DIET:  Resume your normal diet and drink plenty of fluids.  If you are taking narcotics increase your fiber intake.    MEDICATIONS:  You do not have to take pain medication unless it is needed.    Please wean off narcotic pain medication by the follow up visit.  Often pain medication and anesthesia can cause constipation.  Take stool softeners while taking narcotic pain medication.  You can take an over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).  If you become constipated, try products such as Miralax, Dulcolax, or Milk of Magnesia.  You should have a bowel movement at least every 3 days.   Do not strain when going to the bathroom.   Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.   Do not drive while taking narcotic pain medication.     Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc., as this can increase your chances of bleeding.   Check with your surgeon before taking if you are unsure.     GENERAL INFORMATION:  A little soreness after the procedure is normal.   Bruising in the area is normal.   Significant pain can be a sign that something is wrong.   You may feel a small bump at your groin site if that was the \naccess point for your angiogram.   It is the closure device.    Watch for signs of infection including pain, warmth, redness, or fever.   Please call the office if you have significant or new pain.   If you develop any new or unusual back pain, bruising at the puncture site.  Please call the office immediately if you notice any bleeding from the site.   Please call the office with any questions or concerns.     For urgent issues during non-business hours, please call the main hospital line *****-*****-***** and ask for the Neurosurgery resident on call to be paged.     \u00a0                Exam   Temperature: 37.4 \u00b0C (99.3 \u00b0F) (*****\/*****\/***** 1456) | Heart Rate: 94 (*****\/*****\/***** 1456) | BP: (!) *****\/***** (*****\/*****\/***** 1456) | Respiratory Rate: 18 (*****\/*****\/***** 1151)  | SpO2: 98 % (*****\/*****\/***** 1456)  O2 Device: None (Room air) (*****\/*****\/***** 1456)  O2 Flow Rate (L\/min): 2 | FiO2 (%): 21 % (*****\/*****\/***** 1400)      Weight: 106.6 kg (235 lb) (*****\/*****\/***** 0642)  Height: 190.5 cm (6' 3\") (*****\/*****\/***** 0642)         BMI (Calculated): 29.37 (*****\/*****\/***** 0642)    Discharge Exam    Significant Discharge Exam Findings: *****  PERRL, EOMI, peripheral gaze intact, FS, TM  ***** intact  *****\/***** BUE throughout  *****\/***** BLE throughout  SILT  2+ DP\/PT  Groin incision soft, flat without ecchymosis             Orientation Level: Oriented X3   Cognition: Follows commands         Speech: Clear     Special Needs    Special Needs: None              Data\/Results    Results are shown for the following tests if performed (CBC, ***** 7, Mg, Coag).

He had multilevel cervical stenosis w\/ myelopathy and presents to inpatient rehabilitation following a suboccipital decompression, C1-C7 laminectomy and medial facetectomy on *****\/*****\/***** with Dr. *****.    Hospital Course While at *****:    1. Rehabilitation: The patient improved functionally throughout the hospitalization. At this time the patient's functional status is listed below:    Physical Therapy Discharge Functional report: At the time of admission the patient was Supervision with rolling to the left and Supervision with rolling to the right. The patient was Moderate assist with supine to sit activities, and Minimum assist x 1 with sit to stand activities.

Patient will be discharged home to ***** ***** rehabilitation process with therapy as arranged by the case manager.    2. Pain: Patient's pain was difficult to manage during this admission. He has minimal pain while lying in bed but his pain increases significantly when sitting, moving, or trying to complete functional tasks. He complained of pain in his neck and bilateral shoulders. His most severe pain comes from his R shoulder and travels down his R arm. Patient's surgeon, Dr. ***** was informed of the pain and recommended a course of steroids, unfortunately steroids had minimal effect on pain. Celebrex was started also with minimal effect and eventually discontinued. A fentanyl patch was tried and discontinued shortly after due \nto sedation and confusion.     Patient does not consistently ask for prn pain medications. His pain regimen worked best with scheduled oxycodone 5 mg at 0900 and 1300 along with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn. Patient also took gabapentin 800 mg TID, valium 5 mg nightly, and acetaminophen 650 mg q6h. Voltaren gel and lidocaine patches were added with some effect.     Non-opiate alternatives were considered and deemed inadequate alone. I discussed the risks associated with the opioid prescribed. Prior to prescribing the opioid, I utilized the ***** website to review the patient's previous prescriptions. A prescription was provided to the patient for Oxycodone. Patient plans to continue to taper Oxycodone as discussed.    3. DVT prophylaxis: Patient was on DVT prophylaxis Lovenox 40 mg q24h SC, he should continue Lovenox while at *****.     4. Spine: Patient had multilevel cervical stenosis w\/ myelopathy and presents to inpatient rehabilitation following a suboccipital decompression, C1-C7 laminectomy and medial facetectomy on *****\/*****\/***** with Dr. *****. Patient received intensive PT\/OT during his admission, progress outlined above. Patient had a repeat cervical MRI on *****\/*****\/***** after persistent pain affecting his function. The MRI was concerning for ventral subdural hematoma, however the hematoma is expected to reabsorb and surgical intervention is not recommended at this time per Dr. *****. Per Dr. *****, there is no clear explanation for ongoing pain, the patient had no radiculopathy pre-op and his post MRI looks good with the exception of some questionable foramina stenosis. Patient will follow up with neurosurgery again in 1 month.     5. Cardiovascular: Patient reports a history of SVT in the setting of anxiety due to stressful work environment with his brother. He was started on digoxin at that time for that problem. This was over 40 years ago. PCP is weaning this medication appropriately. He had a history of chest pain with \nnegative stress test.  As well as an echo which only showed mild aortic valve thickening and no stenosis (2014). Patient continued digoxin 125 mcg daily and can continue to wean as an outpatient.

He does not experience any urinary incontinence. Neuro exam remained stable throughout hospital course.    10. Endocrine: Patient reports that he has a known history of diabetes and was previously on metformin 500 mg daily. He reports that he is no longer on that medication due to well-controlled blood sugar. He does report that in his prior hospitalization his blood sugars were elevated given the administration of steroids. Patient's blood sugar was monitored daily, eventual blood sugar checks were discontinued due to consistent well controlled sugars.     11. GI\/Nutrition: Patient was seen by nutrition consultant. PO fluids and high protein diet were encouraged. Patient was \nmaintained on stool softeners and laxatives scheduled and as needed to maintain regular bowel movements.    12. FEN\/Renal: Chemistries were checked weekly throughout the hospital course. Renal function and electrolytes remained WNL. PO fluids were encouraged.    13.

Wound Care    You may leave your posterior neck incision open to air.     If there is any concern for a wound infection, contact your surgeon immediately. Do NOT start taking antibiotics without consulting with your surgeon.      Physical Activity    Activity as tolerated.     Continue to follow physical therapy \ninstructions after discharge.    You should be up and walking as much as possible.      Pain Management    Unless you have a history of liver dysfunction, you may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor pain. Do not exceed greater than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen in a 24-hour time period.     You were prescribed an opioid (narcotic) medication\u00a0to help manage more severe pain.\u00a0This class of medications can work well to reduce pain but can be dangerous if used improperly.\u00a0The following information will help to keep you safe.  \u00a0  Safe Use of Opioids  Take opioids only as prescribed. Never take more than instructed, even if you feel your pain is not well managed. Improper use of opioids is a leading cause of accidental death.  Do not combine opioids with alcohol, medicines used to calm anxiety, or other medications that cause sleepiness or sedation.  There is a chance of becoming addicted to this medication. If you have a personal or family history of addiction, this risk is higher. It is important to share this information with your prescriber in order to keep you safe.  Opioid medications can impair your ability to drive or operate other types of machinery safely and you should not drive while taking this medication.  \u00a0  Safe Storage  Your medications are prescribed for only you. Do not share your medication with friends or family members.  Opioid medications must be stored properly, out of the reach of children or others who may be at risk of ingesting them.\u00a0\u00a0Keep opioid medications locked in a safe or lock box (one can be purchased at a pharmacy).  \u00a0  Safe Disposal  Unused medication should be removed from the household as soon as possible through a *****-sponsored drug take-back program. You can find a disposal site near you at:\u00a0*****:\/\/*****.*****.*****.*****\/*****.  If a program is not available, then the FDA recommends flushing unused opioid medication down the toilet to prevent exposure and harm to \nothers.\u00a0See FDA website for medicines recommended for disposal by flushing.\u00a0*****:\/\/*****.*****.*****\/*****\/*****\/*****.*****    Common Side Effects of Opioids  Opioids can cause constipation. You should take a stimulant laxative like senna while taking opioids.\u00a0Opioids can also cause allergic reactions, sedation, respiratory depression (decreased drive to breathe), nausea, vomiting, urinary problems, and itching. Contact your prescriber if you develop these or other symptoms that concern you.\u00a0  \u00a0  Partial ***** of Your Prescription  When filling your prescription, you can choose to receive fewer pills than prescribed from the pharmacy.\u00a0 If you choose this option, you will not be able to receive the remainder of the prescribed pills at a later date.\u00a0\u00a0    As your pain level decreases, you should reduce the number of pills that you take and increase the time between doses in order to wean off of the narcotics as soon as possible. If you have been on narcotics for an extended period of time prior to this admission, do not abruptly stop taking them to avoid withdrawal. Please call your surgeon or PCP if you need guidance on tapering your narcotic medications. Avoid operating heavy machinery, driving, and drinking alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication.       Bowel Regimen    Narcotic pain medication commonly causes constipation. To make it easier to have a bowel movement, consider the following recommendations: Miralax daily and senna\/Colace up to twice daily as needed.    Eat foods high in fiber such as fruits and vegetables.    Increase fluid intake.    Increase walking.    If you begin to experience loose stools or diarrhea, stop bowel medications.      Concerns    If you experience any of the symptoms below, please contact your surgeon or primary care physician right away. Please go to the nearest emergency room during weekends and after business hours.     Fever >101.***** or shaking chills.  Chest \npain or shortness of breath  Increased redness or drainage from the wound (pus or active bleeding).  Severe or persistent nausea or vomiting.

He had a ***** with ***** 3 weeks\n\nago and was subsequently evaluated at ***** found with new left\n\nSDH, that was ultimately felt to be nonsurgical.  The timing of\n\nthis is not quite clear as OSH records from Portsmouth Hospital 2\n\nweeks ago do not show apparently show the bleed.    Historical\n\ndetails from the family and patient are also lacking.  What we do\n\nknow is that over the past month his family reports increased\n\nconfusion, word finding difficulty and \"not making sense,\" as\n\nwell as frequent falls.

While he notices that he had trouble with memory and\n\nconcentration, he attributes these deficits to \"getting old\" and\n\nfeels that his primary need is physical rehabilitation.  Of note,\n\nfor 4-5 years has   also been struggling with back pain and\n\nsuspected abuse of multiple pain medications, including morphine,\n\ntapentadol (*****) and buprenorphine patch (*****).

Labs show INR 1.0, normal\n\nchemistry and CBC, no toxic-metabolic abnormality to account for\n\nhis symptoms.  Imaging obtained from ***** confirms a likely\n\nsubacute infarct, age most likely 4-7 days prior based on DWI+,\n\nbut ADC ***** from hypo to isointensity.  There is\n\nalso a known chronic appearing left frontal subdural but\n\notherwise without substantial atrophy.  \n\n\n\nDifferential for stroke etiology includes small vessel disease,\n\ncardioembolic, *****.  Based on location and risk factors\n\nwe feel small vessel disease likely accounts for this, however\n\ndifficult to exclude cardioembolic phenomenon in the setting of\n\nsuspected noncompliance with pradaxa.  OSH echo was normal,\n\nthough.  ***** possible but unusual location for this and\n\nrecent OSH carotid US was without stenosis or plaque.  With\n\nrespect to question of anticoagulation going forward,  his\n\ncurrent CHADS2 risk score is 4, implying a 8.5% per year risk of\n\nrecurrent stroke.  It is reasonable to restart once out of the\n\nacute SDH window, and he may benefit from switching to once daily\n\nmed like *****. \n\n\n\nWith respect to his AMS, we think this is likely encephalopathy\n\nof multifactorial etiology in the setting of multiple sedating\n\nmedications, ***** with *****\/SDH, ETOH, dehydration,\n\npossible delirium.  The infarct may be contributing to this\n\nmultifactorial picture but does not account for the mental status\n\non its own. \n\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n- No further imaging at this time\n\n- evaluate risk factors for recurrent stroke not previously\n\nassessed including: HbA1c, lipids\n\n- Dr. ***** to make attending-level decision regarding timing of\n\nrestarting anticoagulation in the setting of unknown SDH onset,\n\nconsider switching to ***** long-term as it is QD may be\n\npreferable in the context of suspected medication non-adherence\n\n- limit use of medications that may predispose to encephalopathy\n\n- maintain regular sleep wake cycles \n\n- f\/u with outpatient neurology (***** & van *****)\n\n\n\nNote written with excellent assistance of ***** *****, MSIII\n\n\n\n***** ***** MD\n\nNeuro *****\n\n***** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum by ***** *****, MD on *****\/*****\/***** at 9:46 pm:\n\nI saw ***** ***** *****, reviewed his recent head CT and prior\n\nbrain MRI, as well as Dr. *****'s note above. I agree with the\n\ndetails of care mentioned in his note. I would like to add the\n\nfollowing comments: patient is a ***** year old man with a h\/o AF,\n\npreviously on dabigatran and a prior stroke. States that he fell\n\n3 weeks ago but unclear about the circumstances leading to *****.\n\nDoes not recall the ***** to the hospital. Found to have a\n\nsmall SDH and taken off anticoagulation. A stroke consultation is\n\nbeing sought to weigh in on the risks\/benefit for starting\n\nanticoagulation in light of recent SDH and a prior ischemic\n\nstroke. On my exam, awake, oriented to date, locale. Attention\n\nspan is fair. Speech fluent with normal language functions. ST\n\nrecall *****\/*****. No field cuts. Face symmetrical. Motor\/sensory as\n\nabove. Gait: arises out of bed without assistance. Ambulates with\n\na fair stride length, mildly decreased arm swing and 2 point\n\nturns. Tendency to retropulse on a pull tests.\n\nImp\/Rec: Overall, patient is at an elevated risk of ischemic\n\nstroke in light of his AF and a prior h\/o stroke ( this\n\nautomatically increases his risk >10%\/year). He has a small,\n\nchronic appearing L- sided convexal SDH.

WOUND CARE:  -You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician (increased redness, drainage, foul odor, or other changes concerning to you).    -Your incision was closed with staples.  These will need to be removed. A follow up appointment has been provided to you prior to your discharge. Keep this appointment regardless of your wound closure technique. ____ ***** \n***** ***** CHANGING APPT ***** ***** AND ADDING *****!!!  -Keep your incision clean and dry.  -You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo 4 days after surgery.  -Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.     -Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your physician.    DIET  -Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated, and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may cause constipation.     MEDICATIONS:  -Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough to walk.     -Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.   -Medications that may be prescribed include:                -Narcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone) or Oxycodone.                 -An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or ***** enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and anesthesia can cause constipation.  -If you were on Aspirin,  prior to your surgery, you may safely resume taking this on ____  -Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding.   -If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.     ACTIVITY:  The first few weeks after you are \ndischarged you may feel tired or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again. In general:  -Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor and therapist.  -Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you are feeling good.   -You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.  -If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.  -Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your physician.  -Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.  -Do your breathing exercises every two hours.    -Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you are awake.      WHEN TO CALL YOUR SURGEON:  With any surgery there are risks of complications. Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing. These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes. Call your Physician Immediately if you Experience:  -Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.  -*****, or blurred vision.

Briefly, she is an ***** yo F w\/ pmh notable for osteoporosis and hip fracture s\/p replacement and arthritis who was transferred from ***** ***** ***** with left frontal IPH.    She was last seen well at 12pm on *****\/*****\/*****. At approximately 2:30pm she appeared confused and tired, and her legs appeared weak. She had no other focal symptoms and had been in her usual state of health w\/o any c\/f infection prior. Her confusion progressed and she was brought to ***** where initial CT demonstrated a frontal lobar hemorrhage with associated SAH and intraventricular extension. CTA was \nnegative for aneurysm and ***** ***** was patent. A repeat CT 12 hours later demonstrated that the bleed remained stable. She was subsequently transferred for further management and possible surgical intervention, which was ultimately determined not to be indicated. At baseline, she walks around with a cane and is independent with ADLs. No concerns for dementia process per family though forgetful at times which has been attributed by her family to old age.     After admission an MRV was negative for venous sinus thrombosis. MRI demonstrated scattered cortical ***** and her hemorrhage was thought to be due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, though an underlying mass could not be fully excluded. She should have an MRI in 8-12 weeks after discharge.    Her blood pressure was elevated after presentation, so she was aggressively treated with oral antihypertensives, initially with captopril and then also with carvedilol and amlodipine. On the day of discharge the captopril was converted to lisinopril 20 mg daily and she remained on carvedilol 6.25 mg BID. The amlodipine was discontinued after brief asymptomatic hypotension the night prior to discharge. For worsened hypertension, we suggest increasing the lisinopril dose.    She remained somewhat encephalopathic after her bleed, disoriented to place and time. LTM showed no definite seizures but did show left frontal *****. She was started on levetiracetam 500 mg BID, and a follow-up EEG showed electrographic improvement with disappearance of ***** but continued focal slowing. She was also found to have a UTI and was treated with seven days of antibiotics, with ciprofloxacin to end on *****\/*****\/*****. Her encephalopathy was attributed to a combination of the hemorrhage, the UTI, and hospital delirium, and was expected to improve with treatment of the UTI, resolution of hemorrhage, and removal from the hospital environment. She was given a single dose of 25 mg quetiapine which \nresulted in excessive somnolence, so we suggest at rehab that a low dose of less-sedating antipsychotic such as 0.5 mg haldol be tried if needed for agitation.

Our service had attempted to see the\n\npatient on two occasions, but the patient was inappropriate given\n\nmental status.  The family had a goals of care discussion and the\n\npatient is now CMO.  A feeding tube is not within goals of care. \n\nThe patient has been more awake and alert.  Therefore, the family\n\nrequested our service was consulted to evaluate the patient's\n\noropharyngeal swallowing function to provide strategies to\n\nmaximize comfort and reduce aspiration risk.\t\n\n\n\nImaging:  \n\n*****\/*****: \"Increased right basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis\n\nand\/or pneumonia.

The\n\nrest of her responses were unintelligible.  Unable to assess\n\norientation given mental status. She did not follow commands. \n\n\n\nORAL *****: Unable to complete as the patient did not follow\n\ncommands\n\n\n\nDentition: Incomplete \n\nSecretions: Moist oral cavity; Light coat on tongue. \n\nCough Strength: Adequate\n\n***** Quality: WNL\n\n\n\nPO TRIALS:\n\nPositioning: ***** in bed on ***** 2\n\nConsistencies Trialed: \n\nIce chips\n\nIce cream via deep cut plastic spoon (black spoon), shallow white\n\nplastic spoon.\n\nApplesauce via spoon\n\nPureed fruit via squeezable packet\n\nNectar thick liquids via 60mL catheter syringe, spoon\n\nWater via tsp\n\n\t\n\n\n\nOral Phase: Required stimulation to open her mouth. Decreased\n\nstripping of the bolus from the spoon. Particular difficulty with\n\nstripping ice cream from the deeper spoon (black colored),\n\nimproved with more shallow spoon (white spoon). The patient\n\nadditionally had difficulty stripping PO from the spoon, losing\n\nsmall amounts of all PO anteriorly from the spoon. The patient\n\nbenefitted from using a 60mL catheter syringe placed into the\n\nfront of the patient's mouth to administer liquids and purees.\n\nMild prolonged A-P transfer. Intermittent bolus holding noted.\n\nMild oral residue following the completion of the swallow.\n\n\n\nPharyngeal Phase: Palpable laryngeal elevation which appeared\n\nreduced and delayed. She swallowed up to six times per bolus. The\n\npatient had a vigorous cough with thin water via spoon with tears\n\nin her eyes.  Intermittent coughing\/throat clearing throughout\n\nthe evaluation with all consistencies, similar in nature to\n\nbaseline cough, but more frequent.  \n\n\n\nSUMMARY\/IMPRESSION: The patient presents with overt s\/s of\n\naspiration and is at high risk for aspiration of all\n\nconsistencies. The patient's family has decided to feed the\n\npatient accepting aspiration risk. Therefore, our service is\n\nconsulted to determine ways to reduce aspiration risk and\n\nincrease comfort while eating.  Given impressions at the bedside,\n\nwould recommend that the patient avoid thin liquids as these\n\nappeared to cause discomfort, but the patient may have solids\n\nthat melt into thin liquids (i.e. ice cream, ice chips). Avoid\n\nchewable solids as these may result in an asphyxiation event.\n\nAdditionally, the patient may enjoy smooth purees, and nectar\n\nthick liquids. See recommendations below to encourage reduce\n\naspiration and promote comfortable swallowing. The patient's\n\nfamily was given contact information for the clinician should any\n\nfurther questions arise.\n\n\n\nThis swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake\n\n***** (FOIS) rating of *****\/*****\n\n\n\nPLAN: Our service to remain available if questions\/concerns\n\narise, but will not follow-up unless contacted.\n\n\n\nGoal: \n\n-Patient will successfully consume PO without discomfort.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nProvided to:  *****, *****, MD \n\nContent: Strategies to minimize discomfort while eating.\n\nMode: *****, Written\n\nUnderstanding: Verbally expressed understanding.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR ***** ***** INTAKE (accepting aspiration risk):\n\n1)\tConsume smooth pureed solids, ice cream, ice chips, and nectar\n\nthick liquids.\n\n2)\tMedications: Give liquid medications mixed with nectar thick\n\nliquids (if medications are thin) via syringe as needed\n\n3)\tOral care: Q4 oral care.

Mr. ***** is a ***** yo gentleman who presented with L frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with no significant past medical history.    # ***** ***** intraparenchymal hemorrhage  Mr. *****'s intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) was felt secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). He had been found with aphasia and right sided weakness. He presented to ***** Hospital, where CT showed L-sided hemorrhage with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)\/intraventricular extension, and he was transferred to ***** for further management. He was initially admitted to the *****, where an arterial line was placed. His first repeat CT scan demonstrated very mild expansion of the IPH, with minimal SAH expansion; the next repeat CT was stable. Final dimensions were 5.3 x 3.7cm.  Urine\/serum toxicology screens were unremarkable. CTA was unremarkable of the intracranial vasculature, with no evidence of underlying vascular malformation. The suspicion given the location and the associated SAH was for CAA related bleed, although the differential \nincluded venous sinus thrombosis related bleed. An MRI\/MRV brain was performed - while it was degraded by motion artifact, it confirmed the known intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and did not show any evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. Lipid panel revealed ***** 132, HDL 42, LDL 71, Trig 95, VLDL 19. Keppra was ordered initially but discontinued as the SAH was non-traumatic. His BP was managed as below. Eleven days after admission, the patient suffered an acute decline in mental status, in which he became ***** to sternal rub. A stat ***** ***** revealed new blood products and worsening edema as well as midline shift. He was given mannitol and transferred urgently back to the *****.    In the neuro ICU, he was put on maximal hyperosmolar therapy with mannitol and 23% hypertonic saline. He was taken down to the OR for left craniotomy for evacuation of his left-sided IPH. He was intubated for airway protection. Despite these measures, his serial head CTs continued to demonstrate worsening midline shift and larger amount of left subdural collection. His family was updated daily and were offered placement of another EVD and left subdural hematoma evacuation, however, they declined further surgical interventions. After a long discussion with family, they decided to make the patient comfortable. The etiology of his hemorrhage was thought to be likely amyloid.     # Hypertension  Initial SBP goal <140 for which he briefly required a nicardipine drip before liberalization to <160. Labetalol PO was started and uptitrated to 600mg BID. Captopril was also started, before being switched to Lisinopril.     # Postrenal Acute Kidney Injury  Precipitous increase in ***** from 0.78 to 3.84 around *****\/*****. ***** placed with drainage of almost 1L urine immediately. Cr recovered to 0.77 within two days. ACE inhibitors held at the time.    # Fever \/ Urinary Tract Infection  Intermittently spiking fevers between *****\/*****-*****\/*****. \nUnclear etiology with low suspicion for infection driving fever - WBC remained normal (except for the day after PEG placement); CXR unremarkable; blood cultures with no growth. He did have enterococcus faecalis UTI for which he received Unasyn (*****\/*****-*****\/*****) then Fosfomycin (*****\/*****-to continue until *****\/*****); it was sensitive to both. He was also briefly broadened to Ceftazidime with concern for pulmonary source (*****\/*****-*****\/*****). The fevers were felt potentially secondary to drug reaction from ***** and less likely central cause.    # Incidental thyroid nodule   Left lobe thyroid gland nodule incidentally noted on ***** ***** Head.

This lasted 20 seconds before stopping. The patient's wife gave 1mg PO ativan immediately. About 15 minutes later the same seizure happened and lasted 20 seconds.     The wife thinks that awareness was maintained but for reason gives that eyes were open and he was moving purposefully with the right upper extremity.

Discharge instructions and important events and results    Dear ***** *****,    It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. As you are aware, you were admitted to the hospital for seizures. During your hospitalization, we performed several tests, including a CT scan of your head, which did not show worsening of the blood in your brain. To decrease your risk of additional seizures, a new seizure medication -- Vimpat -- was started and your home Keppra was continued.     There may be changes to your medications. Your new medication list is attached. It is important that you review all medication changes with your nurse before you leave.     We may have scheduled or referred you for follow-up appointment(s). Additional information can be found in this discharge packet. If you do not hear back about a ***** and Women's appointment, then please call (*****) *****-***** to schedule your appointment.    Please let us know if you have any questions.    Please return to the nearest Emergency Room if you experience fevers, confusion, seizures, loss of consciousness, falls, new weakness, new numbness, new slurred speech or new changes in your vision.

Pt reported location of \"Massachusetts\" and year \"1969\".\n\nPt responded to all questions; however, with large volume of\n\ntangential or irrelevant responses. Pt did verbalize some\n\nawareness, such as when he asked if the nectar-thick liquids\n\ncould be less thick. Pt followed basic one- to two-step verbal\n\nand visual commands.

He required cues to open\n\nhis oral cavity when presented with the spoon. He was also very\n\neasily distracted\/impulsive and required cues to stay on task, to\n\ntake small bites, and to not speak with PO in oral cavity.\n\n     Labial closure appeared intermittently incomplete; however,\n\nno anterior loss noted. Mastication was with vertical *****\n\npattern and prolonged. Min oral residue noted, which cleared with\n\nliquid wash. Suspected poor oral control with thin liquids. \n\n\n\n     Pharyngeal Phase: Hyolaryngeal elevation and excursion\n\nappeared adequate to palpation. Pt with one swallow per bolus.\n\nImmediate coughing noted x1 after thin liquid via tsp and x1\n\nafter thin liquid via cup. Pt with weak cued cough following\n\nthese events. Pt denied sensation of aspiration or pharyngeal\n\nresidue. \n\n\n\n     Esophageal Concerns: Pt with hx of GERD. No concerns noted\n\nduring evaluation.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\/IMPRESSIONS:\n\nPatient presents with suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia, most\n\nremarkable for intermittent overt s\/sx of penetration\/aspiration\n\nwith thin liquids and with ineffective mastication of advanced\n\nsolids, in the setting of recent cognitive decline. Recommend\n\ninitiating a diet of nectar-thick liquids and ground solids, meds\n\ncrushed in applesauce. Pt requires supervision with meals, given\n\nimpulsivity and poor safety awareness with PO. Standard\n\naspiration precautions apply, with TID oral care. Recommend SLP\n\nfollow-up upon discharge to nursing facility. We will continue to\n\nfollow during this admission.

The DDx includes seizures, particularly\n\nin the setting of recent SDH near the language area. He should\n\nhave an EEG done as soon as possible to assess for seizures.
