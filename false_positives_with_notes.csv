DISCHARGE SUMMARY    ============================  Hospital Course by Problem:  ============================  # Loss of consciousness  # Recurrent falls  # Progressive supranuclear palsy  History of ***** prior falls c/b SDH x2 most recently in *****/*****. Now presented to ***** ***** on *****/***** after tripping and falling with a *****. Did not lose consciousness or have preceding symptoms. While in ED she developed 
sudden onset nausea and a feeling of warmth and then lost consciousness. Providers could not find a pulse so she received 2 minutes of CPR, although she was not hooked up to any monitors. Subsequently woke up. EKG showed NSR and labs unrevealing (electrolytes and glucose wnl, trop 7>9, tox screen negative) other than elevated prolactin of 204. CTH showed left periorbital soft tissue contusion but no acute intracranial findings. CT C-spine showed no fractures or dislocations. CT CAP notable only for 9.9cm L thigh hematoma. Neurology was consulted. Initial ***** likely mechanical related to PSP and parkinsonism. Syncopal event likely due to vasovagal or orthostatic hypotension from *****. She was evaluated by PT, and orthostatic VS negative for orthostasis. Routine EEG was obtained and was negative for epileptiform activity or seizures. She continued on her home lamotrigine and level was 13 (within range).  [] FOLLOW-UP with neurology, consider MRI brain with contrast    # Incidental pulmonary nodules  [] For a low-risk patient, no routine follow-up is required per ***** criteria. For a high-risk patient, CT in 12 months should be considered.    ============================  Admission History & Physical:  ============================  ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. female with a past medical history of PSP, mild parkinsonism, ***** on lithium, discoid lupus, migraine, and prior subdural hematoma who presents with a ***** concerning for seizure.

Mr. ***** was admitted to the hospital with a transient SIRS-like presentation, though to be due to aspiration in the setting of recurrent gastroparesis. Workup here was notable for an E. Faecium bacteremia treated with daptomycin with quick culture clearance and no vegetations on TTE. Gastroparesis was refractory to medical management and so a GJ tube was placed for venting and feeding. He was started on tube feeds. He was discharged to rehab.     ---------------------------  HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  ---------------------------  #Gastroparesis: The patient presented with worsening gastroparesis on erythromycin therapy. Though the pt was asymptomatic, his belly was quite tympanitic and distended and he had a markedly enlarged gastric bubble on KUB. In the ED, he had an aspiration event (see ""recurrent aspiration""), so an NGT was placed and he was started on metoclopramide (erythromycin was discontinued). Repeat KUB several hours later (while the NGT was on intermittent suction) did not demonstrate adequate compression, and soon ***** the pt became agitated/altered and pulled out his NGT. NGT was replaced and set to continuous wall suction; repeat KUB did show adequate decompression this time. On *****/*****, the pt once again pulled out his NGT, so a trial of medical 
therapy (metoclopramide) alone was undertaken, which did not result in adequate decompression. As such, the decision was made to proceed with placement of a feeding J-tube/venting G-tube, which was successfully placed on *****/*****. Metoclopramide was discontinued at this time. Following placement he was started on tube feeds nocturnally through the J-port. He tolerated these relatively well, initially having some diarrhea and also some refeeding syndrome with low potassium, phosphate and calcium which required repletion. At time of discharge he required minimal supplemental K-phos.  - continue to follow electrolytes daily until stabilized, attempt to pull off K-phos when available   - replete lytes prn     #Aspiration: In the emergency room, the pt became acutely hypotensive to SBP 80s with WBC 17 and new infiltrates on CXR, thought to be consistent with aspiration pneumonitis. The pt's WBC count rapidly improved to 11.77 within 10 hours, and he did not experience any additional hypotensive events. Overall, it was thought that his aspiration was secondary to his gastroparesis, which was managed as above. SLP was consulted and the patient was made NPO. After G tube placement, tube feeds were re-started without episodes of continued aspiration.    #Enterococcal Bacteremia: The pt's blood cultures were positive for VRE (E. Faecium). Though he was started on vancomycin/ceftriaxone for GPC coverage, this was switched to daptomycin/ampicillin upon speciation. Importantly, the pt was able to clear his own cultures prior to starting appropriate antibiotic therapy. Several theories were postulated as to the source of his bacteremia:  A) This represented transient bacteremia in the setting of GI aspiration-->pneumonitis-->bacteremia (supporting evidence: same E. Faecium pathogen growing from sputum)  B) This represented indolent bacteremia from gut translocation in the setting of his recurrent gastroparesis (which may or may not 
have been present prior to his hospitalization)  C) This represented urinary colonization (rare enterococcus, <*****/mL, seen on urine culture)    Given that the pt has a pacemaker implanted, a TTE was obtained, which showed no vegetations. In consultation with ID, the pt was treated with a 4-week course of daptomycin/ampicillin (2 weeks) followed by linezolid (2 weeks) for presumed urosepsis with possible prostatitis (i.e., option C from above). Ampicillin was discontinued when he developed a rash (see below) on the rare chance this was related.   -Continue linezolid (end date: *****/*****)    # Rash: Mr. ***** developed a rash during his hospitalization with multiple erythematous pustules (not ever vesicular) on arms and upper chest. It did not respond to topical steroidals and dermatology was consulted. They biopsied the rash which was pending at time of discharge.  - Follow-up biopsy    # Urinary retention: he was noted to have intermittent urinary retention and was started on flomax in addition to finasteride. He was treated with intermittent straight cath.  - continue straight cath, bladder scan, cath if PVR > 300cc, daily voiding trials    # Diarrhea: With initiation of tube feeds he was noted to have some diarrhea. Since he has denuded sacral skin once he was ruled out for C. Diff we started low-dose loperamide. Could also consider banana ***** or psyllium prn, but likely to resolve as he is further out from initiating tube feeds. If he has a sudden output change he is on antibiotics and would consider ***** *****.

*****/*****), thrombocytopenia,recent admission for chronic subdural

hematoma with midline shift s/p evacuation (*****/*****) who is now

readmitted as a transfer from *****-***** for bilateral posterior

tibial vein thrombosis. He presented initially one week ago with

complaint of lower abdominal pain and was treated with oral

antibiotics for what was thought to be diverticulitis. His

abdominal symptoms are now resolved. However, three days ago, he

developed acute onset of bilateral lower extremity edema that has

persisted. Denies pain, weakness or parasthesias in the legs. No

chest pain or SOB. Of note, he has also developed hematuria

during his OSH stay thought to be secondary to radiation cystitis

that has since resolved. 

Repeat ***** ***** ***** was performed on *****/***** showing

increase in size of his residual SDH from 1.2cm to 2.4cm though

there is no midline shift. Neurosurgery has recommended that no

anticoagulation be started given his recent SDH and chronic

thrombocytopenia. Vascular surgery is now being consulted to

comment on need for possible IVC filter placement given the

contraindication to anticoagulation.

FINDINGS: There is normal *****, flow, and augmentation

of the bilateral common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins.

One of the paired posterior tibial veins demonstrate lack of

***** and lack of flow on color and spectral Doppler

imaging bilaterally, compatible with thrombosis. The peroneal

veins are suboptimally visualized bilaterally. There is normal

respiratory variation in the common femoral veins bilaterally. 

No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (*****) cyst. 

IMPRESSION: Thrombosis of posterior tibial veins bilaterally. 



*****/***** CT head non-contrast: 

FINDINGS: Predominantly hypodense mixed density right

subdural/epidural fluid collection measures 2.4 cm in thickness, 

increased from ***** ***** (previously 1.2 cm). Amount of

hyperdense component in the fluid collection is similar or less

compared to before. There is increased effacement of right

frontal sulci. Leftward midline shift by 4 mm is stable. The

ventricles stable in size and configuration. Right frontal burr

hole is noted. Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the right

sphenoid sinus. The visualized portion of the orbits are

unremarkable. 

IMPRESSION: 

1. Predominantly hypodense mixed density right subdural/epidural 

fluid collection is increased in thickness compared to *****

*****. There is increased right frontal sulcal effacement but

leftward midline shift is unchanged. 



Assessment/plan: ***** history of metastatic prostate cancer (on

chemotherapy), thrombocytopenia, with recent admission for

chronic subdural hematoma with midline shift s/p evacuation

(*****/*****) who is now readmitted as a transfer from *****-***** with

bilateral posterior tibial vein thrombosis. On exam, he has lower

extremity edema to the knee but no skin or neurological changes

with palpable pulses. There is no evidence of threat to limb.

Vascular surgery consulted given neurosurgery concerns that the

patient should not be anticoagulated. Agree with IVC filter

placement with IR service today given they are available. Please

contact us if they are not and we can add on as able.  Keep both

legs ace wrap compressed and elevated. Otherwise vascular surgery

to sign off if not needed for IVC filter placement.

Neurology Resident ***** *****



Reason for Consultation: ?*****



HPI: The patient is a ***** with history of Afib and unprovoked DVT

now off Coumadin due to suspected R traumatic frontal SDH

diagnosed ***** *****, recent hip fracture s/p ORIF *****/*****, CLL

(untreated, followed here) here with two episodes of ***** numbness

and one accompanying ""robotic speech"" and eye closure now

resolved. 

 

In ***** *****, patient had a mechanical fall from tripping on a

slipper without head strike and without loss of consciousness. 

Noncontrast head CT at that time showed what was thought to be

6mm right subdural hematoma with slight midline shift and

effacement of the lateral ventricle and significant sulcal

effacement.  She was also found to have right superior pubic

ramus and ischial fracture as well as rectus sheath hematoma with

active extravasation in the setting of INR of 4.1.  She was

reversed with ***** ***** and vitamin K and her hip fracture was

managed conservatively.  She was then discharged ***** rehab.

She re-presented with a mechanical fall on ***** ***** with posterior

head strike and severe left hip pain.  This is managed with left

hip ORIF on ***** *****.  On this presentation noncontrast head CT

showed unchanged extra-axial hyperdensity in the right subdural

space.  It was noted that this was unusual for subdural hematoma

not evolving over time with differential including slow

hemorrhage vs diffuse dural thickening. MRI was recommended per

radiology.  She was discharged on 500 mg Keppra twice daily. She

re-presented on ***** ***** with worsening pain and inability to

weight-bear on her left leg. ***** films and CT pelvis were

reassuring and she was again discharged with no acute surgical

intervention. NCHCT again repeated with the same unchanged

***** and interpretation.



Today, she presents for 2 episodes of left hand numbness and one

episode accompanied by alteration in speech.  While some

documentation reports left facial droop, it is confirmed with

family that there was no droop or slurred speech on today's

episode. 



The first episode occurred on Saturday when the patient was

sitting at the dinner table.  Patient reports that she

experienced gradual onset numbness in all 5 fingers as well as

possible weakness in the hand.  She would try to pick something

up but was ""unable to"" but she is unsure if this was due to

weakness or the numbness.  Denies any pain.  This episode was

witnessed by 1 of her daughters who felt that when she spoke, one

side of her mouth was not moving but no dysarthria.  The family

also reports that when the episode happened, her left arm was

""hanging"" but patient reports that she was definitely able to

move it.  The symptoms lasted just several minutes per the

daughter.  The patient reports that it lasted around half an

hour.  No adventitious movements were noted by patient or family.

She was not confused afterwards   And was otherwise at her

baseline for the rest of the day in the next day.



Today, at around 5:30 PM, when sitting at the dinner table she

again experienced the same gradual onset left hand numbness

involving all 5 fingers.  In addition, her son reported she was

talking ""strangely"" with a ""robotic like quality"".  For example,

she said the phrase ""I will be okay"" with prolonged spaces in

between the words.  She also started to close her eyes and seemed

to be in a ""***** state"".  Family denies any facial droop or

talking out of one side of her mouth.  No adventitious movements.

Patient reports that she thinks the episode lasted around 30

minutes.





In addition, the patient's daughter reports that she has had

intermittent, very short duration, every other day tingling in

her left hand.  They have also noticed that her left foot has

been swollen for several days.  Of note, she has had increasing

fatigue, increasing pain in her left hip, inability to walk as

well with her walker, and continued night sweats.



On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache,

lightheadedness, or confusion. Denies difficulty with producing

or comprehending speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision,

diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or

dysphagia.  Denies any current muscle weakness, numbness,

paresthesia.  Denies loss of sensation. Denies bowel or bladder

incontinence or retention. + Difficulty with gait and using

walker since her left hip fracture and surgery.



On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or

chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies

cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,

palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or

abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  No

dysuria. ++ Left hip pain.

IMAGING:

Non-Contrast CT of Head: Persistent R subdural hyperintensity

with associated R hemispheric sulcal effacement and R lateral

ventricle effacement and MLS around 5-6mm on my measurement not

significantly changed since *****/***** or *****/*****. 



ASSESSMENT:

***** with history of Afib now off Coumadin due to suspected R

traumatic frontal SDH diagnosed ***** *****, recent hip fracture

s/p ORIF *****/*****, CLL (untreated, followed here) here with two

episodes of ***** numbness and one accompanying ""robotic speech""

and possible altered consciousness, now resolved. 

General exam significant for left more than right ankle edema,

cachexia, pallor, fatigue, severe left leg hip pain with passive

and active ROM. Neurologic exam with normal MS, possible left

visual hemifield neglect with double simultaneous stim, mild L

facial asymmetry with good activation, mild left pronation and

mild UMN pattern weakness in left arm, pain limited testing of

left leg, b/l upgoing toes with decreased reflexes in legs. 



From her description and from the known findings on her NCHCT,

her episodes sound most consistent with seizure vs symptomatic R

subdural/dural process. There is a significant amount of swelling

on her NCHCT in *****, ***** and again today. It is interesting

that the appearance of the subdural collection has not changed

since *****/*****. On her last presentation, an MRI Brain was suggested

and I agree because the lack of change may indicate that the

hyperdense substance is not blood. ***** metastases is a

possibility but is atypical of CLL. If the subdural process is

not blood, then she needs a malignancy workup - ?malignant

conversion of CLL, development of lymphoma?



Given the gradual nature of her symptoms during each episode, the

relatively stereotyped nature of each episode, and the fact that

she has a known/active subdural process causing a significant

amount of sulcal effacement/edema in the right hemisphere, I do

not think that it is likely that these episodes are reflective of

***** (a new process).  I do acknowledge that she is off

anticoagulation and is at risk for ischemic stroke.  However, she

would not be a candidate for any anticoagulation or antiplatelet

until the workup of this subdural process is resolved.



 - MRI Brain w and w/o contrast to evaluate for dural metastases.

Would request that this be done in the ED as it drastically

changes dispo/management. (If the MRI confirms that subdural

process is blood - management per neurosurgery. 

 If the MRI raises the possibility of malignancy - defer workup

and management to oncology in discussion with patient. Workup may

require LP and meningeal biopsy.)

 - Consult neurosurgery given the possibility of a slow subdural

bleed per radiology

 - ***** to neurosurg regarding the need for intervention given

8mm MLS and symptomatic - UMN weakness in the left arm and

episodes of numbness. 

 - Increase Keppra to 1000mg BID

 - If Brain MRI unable to be obtained in the ED, pending

neurosurgery recs, pt could be admitted to oncology since she is

followed here with neurology/***** following. She additionally

is having generalized fatigue, worsening pain from left hip, and

night sweats - may need discussion regarding treatment of CLL. 

 - If oncology feels this is inappropriate, please page us.

Addendum by ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** at 3:18 pm:

The history and examination were reviewed with the neurology

resident. I have interviewed and examined the patient. The

history of present illness, past medical history, family and

social history are described in detail in the neurology resident

notes. The pertinent systems are reviewed.  All other systems are

negative. I agree with the history, examination, assessment and

plan as delineated in the resident note. I would add the

following. 



Ms. ***** states that she is feeling restless today. She recalls

taking medications this morning and wonders if this is related.

She denies any new neurologic symptoms. She recalls that over the

last few months, she has had a few episodes of L hand numbness

and a sensation that her arm is ""ice cold"" lasting for 20-30

minutes. She pointes to the forearm in the T1 distribution and

note that this happens sometimes when she is leaning on her arm.

When it happens her fingers are stiff and difficult to control. 



ROS: She states that she has lost about 10 pounds unintentionally

this year. 



On exam she has diffuse sarcopenia superimposed on focal atrophy

of the *****'s bilaterally, R>L. There is 4+ weakness throughout her

reflexes are 1's throughout except the ankles where they are

absent. Her cortical sensory testing is normal. 



MRI 

IMPRESSION:  

  

1.  Thickening of the extra-axial space with homogeneous

enhancement overlying  the right cerebral hemisphere most likely

reflects lymphoma given the clinical history of CLL, and also

chloroma is a consideration.  There is also abnormal signal

intensity and enhancement within the right masticator space,

likely also lymphoma.  These findings not clearly changed from

the most recent CT head, however are worse from a ***** ***** ***** CT

head and sinus exam.  The extra-axial thickening result in 6 mm

right to left midline shift.  The basilar cisterns are patent. 

2.  Probable small subacute infarct within the left superior

frontal gyrus. 

3.  Diffusely abnormal signal intensity within the bone marrow. 

This may related to anemia, smoking, metabolic disease, and/or

diffuse marrow infiltration. 



Labs: 



79.1 \ 7.8 / 75 

       25.4 



Impression: Ms. ***** is an ***** yo woman with a PMH of CLL who

was admitted after an episode of ""robotic speech"" and L hand

numbness. Her son provided additional history at the bedside

consistent with what is described above. This is more suggestive

of a seizure than ***** although she remains at risk for a stroke.

I agree with the increased dose of Keppra to 1000 mg BID. If she

continues to have symptoms of feeling restless, this can be a

side effect of the keppra however and should be monitored. If she

tolerates it poorly or has recurrent episodes, another AED can be

considered. She does not require an EEG at this time as it would

not change management. 



Her MRI findings are highly concerning for CNS lymphoma. An LP

would be warranted for diagnosis if in line with her goals of

care. Her platelets must be monitored in anticipation of the

procedure as she is prone to thrombocytopenia.



Her MRI identified a probable subacute left superior frontal

gyrus infarct. If possible, she should be started on antiplatelet

therapy and a statin. Her last LDL was 113 *****/*****/*****. Her lipids

and A1c should be rechecked, an MRA of the head and neck should

be obtained and a TTE. She is at high risk for cerebral

infarction due to her history of malignancy.



Her intermittent L forearm numbness is more suggestive of

cervical radiculopathy and she would benefit from a soft collar.

She has a history of reported cervical stenosis.   



Recommendations discussed with the primary team. Please page with

questions. "

DIVISION OF CARDIOLOGY COMPREHENSIVE CONSULTATION NOTE



CHIEF COMPLAINT: Patient is seen in consultation today at the

request of ***** *****-*****, MD. We are asked to give

consultative advice regarding evaluation and management of aortic

stenosis.



Requesting Attending: *****-*****,*****

Outpatient Cardiologist: *****, ***** ***** MD



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. ***** is an ***** y/o man with

history of CAD s/p PCI (***** to RCA and PTCA of the OM2 in 1994

and ***** to mid-RCA 2004), PVD s/p bilateral iliac artery

angioplasty, AAA s/p open repair, HTN, HLD, former smoker, and

history of chronic subdural hematomas who presented for this

admission with lethargy after an unwitnessed ***** and was found

to have unchanged SDH. Cardiology is consulted for evaluation and

management of newly discovered aortic stenosis.



The patient initially presented to ***** on *****/***** after being

found down by his wife in his bathroom. The patient reports that

he felt a pain in his leg and grabbed for the shower ***** but

fell and hit his head. He denies any antecedent chest pain,

palpitations, or shortness of breath. A NCHCT showed bilateral,

chronic SDH. During his hospitalization he was admitted to the

neurosurgical service for monitoring and was treated with keppra

for 7 days. He was discharged to rehab on *****/*****.  



On *****/*****, the patient was readmitted after family concern for

increased lethargy revealed increased size of his chronic SDH.

The patient went to the OR on *****/***** for relief of cerebral

compression, which was uncomplicated. Repeat NCHCT on *****/*****

demonstrated stability of the SDH and the patient was discharged

to rehab. During this hospitalization he was also noted to have

recurrent episodes of NSVT including one episode on reported VT

on *****/***** in the ?PACU with flat A-line, reportedly recovered

without intervention.  



While at rehab the patient was noted to be climbing out of his

bed and may have had an unwitnessed ***** after being found on the

floor of his room on his hands and knees. The patient does not

recall the circumstances of this *****. He had repeat head imaging

and was also seen by neurosurgery who stated that his SDH was

stable and that he required no neurosurgical intervention. He was

admitted to medicine for further evaluation of his *****.



On interview, the patient reports that he feels well. His head is

sore, and an old left shoulder injury is bothering him. But

otherwise he denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or

palpitations. He tells me that he is able to climb a flight of

stairs with difficulty. He denies any other complaints.



A full 10 point review of systems was reviewed and is otherwise

negative in detail.

TELEMETRY *****/*****/*****: NSR



#ECG *****/*****/***** (03;16): NSR at 67 bpm, left axis deviation, LBBB

(known), ST elevations and T wave inversions in V1-V3 (new

compared to ECG from *****/*****/*****)



#ECHO *****/*****/*****:

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is

moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left

ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left

ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior

hypokinesis. Diastolic function could not be assessed. The right

ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall

contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately

thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not

quantified). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve

leaflets are not well seen. There is moderate functional mitral

stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg at a heart rate of 102 bpm) due to

mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation

is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be

determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 



IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. 

1) Moderate LVH with mild regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w

prior myocardial infarction in the RCA territory.

2) Significant aortic stenosis is present (visual assessment for

parasternal short axis) however was not further quantified using

traditional methods. However, judging from the LV to ***** pressure

difference, the aortic stenosis severity is likely severe.

3) Moderate mitral annular calcification with moderate mitral

regurgitation and moderate functional mitral stenosis.



Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of *****/*****/*****,

there now is AS and ***** with functional *****. ***** has progressed.



#ECHO (*****/*****/*****):

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild regional left

ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal

inferior wall. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No

aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are

mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The

estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is

no pericardial effusion.  



#Cardiac catheterization (*****/*****/*****):



1.Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 

demonstrated no significant flow-limiting lesions. The LMCA was 

angiographically normal. The LAD had mild luminal irregularities.

The LCX had a 30% proximal stenosis, and OM1 had a 40% stenosis. 

The RCA had a 30% proximal stenosis and a widely patent

previously-placed ***** stent. 

2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate systemic

arterial hypertension with an aortic pressure of *****/***** mmHg. 

  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     

1. No angiographically-apparent flow-limiting coronary artery

disease. 

2. Moderate systemic arterial hypertension. 



#Cardiac catheterization (*****/*****/*****):

1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant 

circulation. The LMCA was without angiographically-apparent 

flow-limiting disease. The LAD was free of angiographic apparent

lesions until mild disease of 50% was seen in the mid vessel near

the takeoff of a moderate-sized first diagonal. The remainder of

the LAD and its smaller diagonal and septal branches were without

angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The LCX had a

50% stenosis at the takeoff of a moderate-sized OM1. The

remainder of the distal LCX was without angiographically-*****

flow limiting disease through its course in the AV groove. The

RCA was dominant vessel and had a 20% proximal stenosis and a 90%

stenosis near the takeoff of the first marginal. 

2. Left sided filling pressures were high normal. 

3. Left ventriculogram showed an LVEF of 55% with preserved LV

function. 

4. The right iliac artery was tortuous requiring a glidewire for

access. 

5. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.***** ***** *****

(See 

PTCA comments). 

  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     

1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 

2. Normal ventricular function. 

3. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was high normal. 

4. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with a Drug Eluting Stent. 



#Cardiac catheterization (*****/*****/*****):



COMMENTS: 1) Angiography revealed a normal Left Main, minimal 

disease in the LAD, a 60-70% eccentric lesion in the LCX at the

level of the OM1 and a 30% lesion at the origin of the OM1, and a

90% lesion in the mid-portion of a large branching OM2.  The RCA

was occluded in its mid-portion with the distal vessel and its

branches filling by ***** and left to right collaterals. 

2) Resting hemodynamics were within normal limits. 

3) Successful stent placement in the RCA and PTCA of the OM2 (see

PTCA comments for details). 

  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     

1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 

2. Successful stent placement in the RCA, and successful PTCA of

the OM2. 



#Cardiac catheterization (*****/*****/*****):

1. Coronary arteriography of this right dominant system revealed 

two-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LM was normal.  The LAD

had only mild luminal irregularities; D1 had a 20% stenosis. The

LCX had diffuse disease with a maximal stenosis of 30% at its

proximal portion; OM1 had a 30% stenosis; a large OM2 had a 95%

stenosis. The RCA was subtotally occluded proximally and filled

distally anterograde and via left-to-right collaterals. 

2. The resting hemodynamic parameters were remarkable for

elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 20 mmHg), with a

normal cardiac index. 

3. ***** left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 59%

with mild inferoapical hypokinesis. 

4. Aortography revealed severe aortoiliac disease with subtotal 

occlusion of the right iliac artery (see Radiology report for

details). 

5. Acute urinary retention was treated successfully with a ***** 

catheter. 

  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     

1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 

2. Mild systolic and moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 

3. Aortoiliac disease (see Radiology report).

ASSESSMENT: Mr. ***** is an ***** y/o man with history of CAD s/p

PCI (***** to RCA and PTCA of the OM2 in 1994 and ***** to mid-RCA

2004), PVD s/p bilateral iliac artery angioplasty, AAA s/p open

repair, HTN, HLD, former smoker, and history of chronic subdural

hematomas who presented for this admission with lethargy after an

unwitnessed ***** and was found to have unchanged SDH. Cardiology

is consulted for evaluation and management of newly discovered

aortic stenosis.



It is unclear at this time whether the patient's ***** is related

to his newly-discovered aortic stenosis. The patient reports that

he has good exercise tolerance and is able to climb a flight of

stairs without chest discomfort or shortness of breath. He is not

able to identify any antecedent symptoms for his *****. His aortic

valve area and gradient cannot be quantified on his

echocardiogram due to suboptimal image quality. Therefore we

recommend a repeat focused echocardiogram with ***** probe to

examine the aortic valve and LVOT with and without valsalva.



The patient is also noted to be orthostatic by blood pressure

criteria, which may have contributed to his *****. We recommend

holding the patient's ISDN given his orthostasis.



Thus far, he has had no arrhythmias on telemetry that would

explain his *****. However, his ECG from *****/*****/***** does show new

ST-T wave changes compared with prior. The patient is

asymptomatic, although he has been taking ISDN. His troponins are

mildly elevated with flat MB. We do not think he is having ACS

and he does not require urgent cardiac catheterization at this

time. If repeat focused echocardiogram confirms severe AS, the

patient would likely require angiography as part of evaluation

for valve repair.



RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Repeat focused echocardiogram to evaluate aortic valve

- Hold isosorbide dinitrate

- Restart aspirin when able to do so safely from neurosurgical

perspective



These recommendations are preliminary until reviewed by an

attending ***** ***** below.

***** PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION



CHIEF COMPLAINT (with identification of patient, consultee, and

sources with contact info): Agitation with QTc 530



DURATION (TOTAL UNIT TIME AND FACE-TO-FACE TIME) and COMPONENTS

IF RELEVANT (E/M, C/C, Psychotherapy): 60 minutes



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

     Mr. ***** is a ***** year old man with a PMH of HTN, DM, CAD

s/p CABG, AF, MR s/p bioprosthetic MVR, high degree AV block s/p

dual chamber PPM, chronic subdural hematomas, and dementia, who

was noted to be more lethargic than usual at his SNF, who was

sent to the ***** ***** and found to be bradycardic, and was

transferred to ***** for further evaluation and planned generator

change tomorrow. The patient became agitated overnight, and

psychiatry was consulted for recommendations for managing

agitation.

     The patient had reportedly become more lethargic and

fatigued than usual while at his nursing home. He had abrasions

on his left leg, which were concerning for a possible *****. He

was sent to the ***** *****, where head imaging was reassuring. When

he was found to be bradycardic in the high 30s-40s, he was

transferred to *****. He was admitted with the plan for a

generator change tomorrow morning. The patient became acutely

agitated overnight, trying to choke staff and pulling out lines.

He was on telemetry, but he pulled the leads off. Given his

*****, his QTc was 530, and he received 0.5mg IM Ativan x1.

No antipsychotics were administered. When this writer arrived at

the patient's room, he was found lying in bed asleep in physical

restraints. When his name ***** *****, ***** ***** ***** few phrases

that could not be understood. He was unable to open his eyes

voluntarily. 



Collateral information from the patient's son, *****-*****-*****:

At his baseline, he has no patience for hospitals or doctors. He

will ***** out his tubes and walk on out. At the nursing home, he

is much better. He's not happy, but he has a higher degree of

understanding and acceptance. He recognizes his children, but he

may forget a grandchild. He might know who the president *****. He

doesn't usually know what day of the week it is. He usually knows

where he is. He'll be close to the correct year. At the SNF, he

does not get agitated to the point where he would swing out at

somebody. Currently, he is able to dress himself and clean

himself. He is able to feed himself. He's been in the Carriage

***** for 6-7 weeks. He lives in the memory loss unit, which is a

locked unit. Over the last few months, it appears that the

dementia has been getting worse. His dementia first started 2

years ago. Yesterday he was more lethargic than usual. Normally,

he has a good ***** of energy. He spends his day sitting in a

chair, reading a newspaper for 10 minutes, sleeping for 15

minutes, etc. He spends most days with off and on naps. He's

normally able to sleep at night. He was never suicidal. *****-*****

months ago, he had visual hallucinations, but not at baseline.

DSM 5 DIAGNOSIS:

delirium



ASSESSMENT:

     Mr. ***** is a ***** year old man with a PMH of HTN, DM, CAD

s/p CABG, AF, MR s/p bioprosthetic MVR, high degree AV block s/p

dual chamber PPM, chronic subdural hematomas, and dementia, who

was noted to be more lethargic than usual at his SNF, who was

sent to the ***** ***** and found to be bradycardic, and was

transferred to ***** for further evaluation and planned generator

change tomorrow. The patient became agitated overnight, and

psychiatry was consulted for recommendations for managing

agitation.

     Mr. ***** is likely delirious, as he has an altered mental

status with increased fatigue at his nursing home, and now acute

agitation overnight. This pattern of being more fatigued than

usual, and then agitated, is consistent with the waxing and

waning pattern of delirium, as opposed to a more consistent

pattern of dementia. Collateral information from the patient's

son indicates that at baseline the patient is relatively calm,

sitting in a chair and reading a newspaper, and that this level

of agitation is very unusual for him. 

     Possible etiologies for delirium in this patient include

toxic-metabolic, infectious, seizures (pt was previously on

keppra which was reportedly tapered off), CVA (multiple vascular

risk factors), hypoxic damage *****/***** hypoperfusion in the setting of

bradycardia, or a worsening of his chronic subdural hematoma,

though this is less likely given reassuring head imaging at the

OSH. 

     As the patient's QTc is currently 530, and he cannot be

monitored on telemetry as he has ripped off his leads, we would

recommend holding all antipsychotics and QTc ***** agents.

Please see below for recommendations.



RECOMMENDATIONS:

-patient is currently delirious with likely etiologies including:

toxic-metabolic, infectious, seizures, CVA, hypoxic damage *****/*****

hypoperfusion in the setting of bradycardia, or a worsening of

his chronic subdural hematoma, another neurological condition

-would advise judicious use of deliriogenic medications

(specifically *****, pain medications, and

anticholinergics)&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206

;

-patient should be monitored on constant observation 



-as QTc is 530, would recommend avoiding antipsychotics

-avoid QTc ***** agents if possible

-benzodiazepines are deliriogenic, however in this case

controlling the patient's agitation to allow him to have this

procedure may outweigh this risk

-in cases of extreme agitation where the benefits of chemical

restraints outweigh the risks, would recommend the

following:&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;

ativan 0.25mg IM x1, if no response after 30 minutes can repeat

once

-please obtain full neuro exam when possible and consider a full

neurological and medical work-up for causes of delirium

-pt was previously on keppra, which was recently stopped, could

the patient be having seizures? Could consider EEG.

-consider consulting neurology



-would advise that pain can be a major source of

delirium&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;

-would advise that patient should have a regulated sleep/wake

cycle&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;&#8206;

-would advise that patient should have mechanical restraints

(e.g. soft-restraints vs. ***** vest) as necessary if in agitated

delirium but these should be used only if necessary to prevent

harm to patient or others&#8206;

&#8206;-would advise orienting stimuli (e.g. reminding patient of

their current situation frequently) and involvement of family and

friends as appropriate to reassure and calm patient&#8206; (they

can bring in photographs if this is helpful for family)

There, he was 
reported to have ***** of clear fluid from his R nares while bearing down in bathroom. On the day before presentation, he started to develop lethargy, altered mental status, and fevers. He went to ***** where CTH was significant for pneumocephalus and facial fx, and CXR was significant for multifocal PNA. LP here shows concern for meningitis. EVD placed *****/*****. S/P *****, nasoseptal flap for repair of skull base defect *****/*****. Obvious defect encountered with + fluorescein in sphenoidal sinus.      Mr. ***** was admitted to the ***** on *****/*****/***** and was admitted to the Medical ICU. On presentation to the *****, the patient was febrile to *****.***** and tachypneic to 24 on room air, but other VSS and wnl. His exam was notable for PERRL, dysconjugate gaze, neck stiffness, bibasilar crackles, movement of all extremities spontaneously, and intermittent ability to follow commands.     With guidance by the ID team, he was broadened to vanc/meropenem given concern for nosocomial meningitis, and then linezolid/meropenem when he was found to be VRE colonized. He remained intermittently febrile, with Tmax 101.***** on *****/*****, and WBCs stable at ~19. His PO steroids from ***** were converted to IV solumedrol 48mg qday. The steroids were ultimately tapered per ENT recommendations. Neurology, ENT and OMFS were also consulted, who reviewed a repeat CT head/neck/sinuses and deemed that the facial fracture was stable, although a combo endo/open repair of the CSF leak is being considered by Neurosurg/ENT once the patient is medically stable. 20% R ear TM perforation noted by ENT. Per neuro recs, an MRI brain has been ordered. His mental status per family has reportedly improved from his ED presentation, as he will sometimes respond to his name. Intermittent EEG was placed and was negative for seizures.     On *****/*****/***** he was Transferred to the medicine floor. Neurology, ENT and OMFS were also consulted. They reviewed a repeat CT head/neck/sinuses and 
deemed that the facial fracture was stable, although a combo endo/open repair of the CSF leak is being considered by Neurosurg/ENT once the patient is medically stable. On *****/***** He unfortunately declined overnight with concerning MRI imaging findings. He was ***** to the ICU for management of his persistent somnolence.     ----------------- Transferred to Neurosurgery -------------------    On *****/***** he was transferred to the ***** 6 Neuro ICU service under the care of Neurosurgery. He was intubated and an EVD was placed. Please see separately dictated procedure note by Dr. ***** ***** for details of this procedure.     On *****/*****/***** he was prepped and taken to the OR for an endoscopic endonasal repair of a CSF leak as well as an occlusion balloon test.  Please see separately dictated operative note by Dr. ***** and Dr. ***** ***** for details of this procedure.  Postoperatively, the patient remained intubated and transferred to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit (Neuro ICU) for continuous neurological surveillance and blood pressure control. Post-operatively, his right radial area was flat without hematoma, right hand was warm and well perfused.    He underwent routine post-operative care including periop antibiotics which were continued per ID recommendations and post-operative imaging that was completed and reviewed. He was found to have pneumocephalus for which the EVD remained in place. He remained intubated and an NG tube was placed. His blood pressure was monitored closely. Spot EEG was placed for fluctuating mental status which showed epileptiform discharges but no seizures. He was started on a trial of Keppra x3 days. Serial head CT's were obtained which showed improvement in pneumocephalus.    On *****/*****/***** he was extubated and slowly weaned to room air. His foley catheter was discontinued, and he subsequently required intermittent straight catheterization. He was restarted on his home flomax, 
however, despite several voiding trials he ultimately needed the catheter replaced on *****/*****/*****. At rehab, he should have another voiding and if unsuccessful, he should follow up in the Urology clinic.     His course was complicated by multiple infections for which the Infectious Disease team followed closely throughout his hospitalization and provided recommendations surrounding antibiotics. These antibiotics  included Linezolid and Meropenem for bacterial meningitis until *****/*****/*****, which was 2 weeks from surgery on *****/***** and presumed source control.  IV ambisome and flucytosine was started for complex fungal meningitis, which was eventually narrowed to fluconazole for a total 4-week course.  and a 5-day course of Cefepime for a hospital acquired pneumonia. He had an LP on *****/*****/*****, which showed no growth, and he had a repeat LP on *****/*****/***** (with results pending at the time of discharge). His antibiotic/antifungal regimen at discharge was PO Fluconazole 40mg daily ending on *****/*****/*****; and he should continue on PO Bactrim for a total of 3 days, day 1 was *****/*****/***** for a new UTI.      Endocrine was consulted for a question of adrenal insufficiency as evidenced by hypotension. At their discretion, steroids were started and titrated and he will continue on a slow steroid wean and will followed by endocrine as an outpatient. Taper as below:  - Prednisolone 25 mg po daily x1 week  - Prednisolone 20 mg po daily x 1 week  - Prednisolone 15 mg daily x 2 week.   - He should then have a fu at ***** clinic: ***** ***** at 1:30pm. After that his prednisolone may be adjusted.   Please do not stop GC abruptly.     The Neurology service was consulted on 01/0/2020 for concern of seizures. His Keppra was increased to ***** BID pending an EEG, which was obtained on *****/*****/*****. The EEG showed no frank seizures, and combined with a low clinical suspicion the Keppra was decreased to 500mg BID. He continued to be stable with no 
clinical concern for seizures, so his Keppra was discontinued prior to discharge.     His Ng tube remained and he continued to be followed by SLP who recommended the placement of a Peg tube for adequate nutrition and safe medication administration. On *****/*****/***** he was prepped and taken to interventional radiology for the placement of a G tube. Please see separately dictated procedure note by Dr. ***** ***** for details of this procedure. His tube feeds were advanced per protocol and he tolerated without issue.    His nasal packing remained in place per ENT and was ultimately removed on *****/*****/*****. His EVD remained at zero and open and the output and ICP's were monitored closely. It was slowly titrated starting on *****/***** and on *****/*****/***** the EVD was removed. It was removed at the bedside without complication and the incision was closed with a single absorbable suture.      He was then determined to be medically stable to transfer from the Neuro ICU to the neurosurgery floor service on *****/*****/*****. He was seen and evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy in anticipation of discharge. They recommended discharge to inpatient rehab to optimize his recovery.    By the day of discharge on *****/*****/*****, he continued to progress well, voiding good amounts of urine, and tolerating a diet with no complaints of nausea or vomiting. His vital signs were within normal limits on room air. He elicited only minimal discomfort and expressed readiness for discharge to inpatient rehab.

Our physicians and technologists are dedicated to providing highly skilled and compassionate care for you and your family. We understand that you may be apprehensive about your procedure. We hope that you will find the following information helpful as you prepare for the exam.  What should I expect BEFORE my CT scan? ***** When to arrive: You need to arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment. ***** Medications: It is important for you to keep your regular medication schedule. Please take all the medications that have been prescribed to you by your doctor and bring a list to your CT appointment. ***** Diabetic conditions: If you are an insulin-dependent diabetic, please continue to take your insulin as prescribed, but remember to drink extra fruit juices to make up for the fasting of solid foods for the 2 period that your stomach is empty. Patients who are taking diabetic medications should take the prescribed dose as normally done on that day. Patients should notify their Primary Care Physician (PCP) that they had contrast and were instructed to 
discontinue their medication for 48 hours. If you need a substitute medication, please consult your doctor. ***** Food and drink: You should not eat solid foods for two hours prior to your test. You may, however, drink plenty of fluids, such as water, broth, clear soups, juice, or black ***** coffee or tea. We encourage you to drink plenty of fluids before your arrival to our facility. ***** What to wear: You should dress in comfortable clothing. It might be necessary for you to change into a hospital gown if there is metal in your clothing, such as a ***** or *****, within the area of interest of your study. If you are wearing jewelry or anything else that might interfere with your scan, we will ask you to remove it. It is best that you leave your valuable items at home. ***** Intravenous preparation: Many patients receive a contrast agent intravenously (IV) during their CT test. If your doctor or the radiologist has determined that this procedure will enhance your CT scan results, the technologist will place an IV in your arm or hand prior to going into the exam.  During the Scan: You will meet the CT technologist when you are taken into the exam room. The technologist will explain everything that is happening. You will be helped onto the table, positioned correctly and may be secured by a strap which helps prevent you from moving. ***** slight movement blurs the x-rays.  The CT technologist controls the procedure in another room where they can still see and hear you. You will be moved slightly after each scan, although you may not notice the change. When the CT scan is complete, the technologist will make sure he or she has all the information the doctor will need. Your time in the CT scan room will vary between 10 and 20 minutes per test depending on the procedure.  After your Scan: Once the technologist has all the images the physician requires, they will assist you off of the table. You are discharged immediately 
and you may resume your normal diet. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids for several days unless otherwise contraindicated. If you become constipated make sure you speak to the physician that ordered the test.  Contrast reactions happen rarely after leaving the hospital. However if you develop a skin rash, difficulty breathing or severe nausea or vomiting please contact your physician. If your symptoms are severe, call 911 or go to the closest emergency room.  The technologist cannot discuss results with you. The CT scan will be reviewed by a Radiologist and the results will be sent to the doctor who ordered your exam.

Medications:   • You may use Tylenol (Acetaminophen) for your pain. Do not take more than 4000 mg of Tylenol per day.   • You may use prescribed narcotics for severe pain. As your pain improves, wean this medication as tolerated.   • Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain 
medications.   • Constipation is a common problem when using narcotics after surgery - use Colace (stool softener), fiber laxatives and/or *****, Senokot, Milk of Magnesia to prevent and treat constipation. Stay well-hydrated.   • Resume the rest of your medications at their usual doses unless otherwise indicated.   • Do NOT take any blood thinning medications (Aspirin, Ibuprofen/other NSAIDS, Plavix, Coumadin) unless otherwise instructed or you are cleared by your neurosurgeon.   • If you were discharged with Keppra (levetiracetam), this medication helps to prevent seizures. Please take as instructed.   • If you have been discharged on Decadron (dexamethasone), this is to help with brain swelling. Please take as instructed.       After a craniotomy you may experience:  • Headaches- They should respond to pain medications.

Nausea/Vomiting    Call your Neurosurgeons office directly with questions.  If off hours, or weekends/holidays: Call the ***** Paging Service at *****-*****-***** and have the Neurosurgery Resident on call paged to your home number.      Call 911 for any Loss of Consciousness or seizure activity.               Additional Clinician Instructions for Diet     Include protein in your diet to aid in wound healing, and to give you energy to participate in therapy if it is necessary for you.    Good examples of protein are : lean meats, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts.    If your jaw or throat is sore from surgery eating soft cold foods may be easier.    Protein smoothies are a good option when you are not very hungry.  You can add fruits, protein powder or yogurt to any liquid you 
like, add ice and ***** in *****.           Additional Clinician Instructions for Activity     No strenuous activity until after your follow up:   no running, jogging, *****, or stationary bicycles.  Do not lift anything greater than 10lbs, which is roughly a gallon of milk.  No housework such as vacuuming, or laundry until after your follow up.    Walking is encouraged, to prevent blood clots from forming in your legs.  Take at least 5 short walks a day around your house; in the morning, after each meal and at bedtime.    Change your position frequently and do not cross your legs.   If driving for longer than one hour, take breaks to stretch your legs.    Take your time changing your positions, getting out of bed, up from chair, etc to avoid dizziness.    Keep your head above your shoulders when you have to pick up anything from floor; bend at your knees.  We suggest sitting to put on clothing, shoes etc to avoid dizziness.    REST when you are tired.  It is normal to be more tired for 4-6 weeks after brain surgery.    No driving until cleared by your Neurosurgeon.

Once your sutures are removed you may wash your hair as normal.    Monitor for signs of infection:  Any increase in redness or swelling?  Any drainage noted?  Increase in pain at incision?

  Neurologic: ***** ***** ***** was admitted to the Neurosurgical service on *****/*****/***** after presenting with subacute confusion, gait instability. A CT of the head was performed, showing chronic left SDH he was admitted and prepped for surgery. The Medicine Service and Dr. ***** of Cardiology were consulted for assistance with medical management. Prior to admission he had been on Warfarin, ASA and Plavix (for AF and CAD w/***** in 2013). He was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. On *****/*****/***** he was taken to the OR for a ***** hole drainage of the SDH with placement of a ***** ***** drain.  Please see separately dictated operative note by Dr. ***** ***** for details of this procedure. The procedure complicated by aberrant, rapid AF and hypotension. Postoperatively, the patient was extubated and transferred to the Neuro ICU for continued neurological surveillance and SBP/HR control.  An arterial line was placed. He was given 8 mg IV Metop and Esmolol, after which the tachycardia resolved. His Troponin was cycled as part of his post-op course. He was found to have mild elevation to 0.0 4 (which may have been somewhat unreliable in setting of AKI). It was ***** until a downward trend was appreciated.     He was notably unresponsive to sternal rub on *****/*****/*****. A Stat CT head was performed, and negative. He spontaneously improved following this although was delirious and unable to follow commands and he was unable to pass a swallow evaluation leading to a concern for aspiration.  ***** ***** tube was placed, and SLP and nutrition consulted. Tube feedings were titrated to goal without difficulty. On *****/***** the JP drain was discontinued. He was cleared for transfer to a neurosurgical floor on *****/***** and he was started on Levaquin for Klebsiella noted in the sputum he was on antibiotic's from *****/*****-*****/*****. On *****/*****, he was noted to have a bump in his Cr to 1.47 from baseline of 1.1. Medicine was consulted, who felt the AKI 
etiology was pre-renal. Nephrotoxic medications were ***** and he was given additional fluids. In the coming days, his Cr began to downward trend to his baseline.  G tube was placed without complication on *****/*****/*****.     A follow up head CT was done on *****/*****/***** and stable. He was started on his home regular dose of Coumadin with goal INR *****-*****. Plan to get outpatient CT head once therapeutic. Also plan to stop heparin for DVT prophylaxis once INR is therapeutic.     Throughout this hospitalization, he had several runs of self-limited (<10 beats), asymptomatic runs of rapid afib that appear similar in morphology to *****. Medicine felt this to be not concerning given normal electrolytes and stable troponin. They did not recommend any changes to his metoprolol regimen.     On the morning of discharge he was found to be afebrile with stable vital signs. Neurologically he was ***** (self, baseline since admission). PERRL, FS. Followed simple one ***** commands, at least antigravity x 4 . His incision sites were open to air and healing well.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Headache



REASON FOR CONSULT: evaluation for timing of anticoagulation



HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  

Mr. ***** is a ***** on coumadin for a mechanical MV w h/o stroke

in 2009 in the setting of subtherapeutic INR (1.4)who presented

on *****/*****/***** with headaches for 5 days. Patient went to his PCP who

recommended MRI performed at ***** which showed a 1.9cm subdural

hematoma on the R side with 1.2 MLS. He was ***** to OSH

where INR was found to be 5.4. The patient received vitamin K 10

units IV as well as ***** ***** 2500 units. There were no focal

neurologic symptoms. The patient has had a GCS of 15. He was

***** to *****, where he subsequently underwent evacuation

of the hematoma on *****/*****, with subsequent recurrence and

evacuation on *****/*****, with stable NCHCT on *****/*****. Patient noted no

inciting trauma before this event and his most recent INR before

presentation was 2.5. He was on a dose of 6mg of coumadin for the

three weeks before presentation, and had been on 5mg before that.

Patient currently notes improved headache, at *****/***** now. No chest

pain, SOB, pain elsewhere. No GI symptoms.

LABS/STUDIES:

INR 1.0

See below  



EKG:  

'Sinus rhythm. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2, likely a normal

variant. 

Non-specific T wave flattening. Compared to the previous tracing

of *****-*****-***** *****-T wave flattening is more prominent.' 



2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  

(2007):

PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is seen

in the left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is

seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is

seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses

are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular

systolic function is normal. The ascending, transverse and

descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of

atherosclerotic plaque. There are simple atheroma in the

descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets.

No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is

no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The

mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve

leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve

prolapse of the anterior leaflet.. There is partial mitral

leaflet flail of the A2 leaflet. No mass or vegetation is seen on

the mitral valve. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The

mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric and directed posteriorly..

The mitral annulus is enlarged and measured 3.9. The tricuspid

valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid

regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

POST-CPB: On phenylephrine drip. Well-seated mechanical valve in

the mitral position. Trivial MR along washing jets. 3-D

reconstruction shows good valve excursion. MS gradient of 5 mmhg

at ***** ***** of 5.5 L/min. There is preserved biventricular

systolic function. The aortic contour is normal post-

decannulation.  



CT:

1.7 cm R subdural chronic subdural hematoma with 1.5 left midline

shift





ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

***** yo M with history of mechanical MV replacement, stroke in 2009

in the setting of subtherapeutic INR (1.4), who presented with

subdural hematoma on *****/***** in the setting of supratherapeutic INR

to 5.4. While an INR of 5.4 would not be expected to cause a

spontaneous bleed, it is possible his INR had been higher prior

to this result, or that previous embolism given had predisposed

the area to bleeding as patient has history of right-sided MCA

distribution infarcts. Given the patient has a mechanical mitral

valve and a previous history of likely cardiac thromboembolic

stroke, there is a significant risk of thrombosis. There is a

~4-8% risk per year of thrombotic events in patients without

anticoagulation and mechanical valves, but this number may be

much higher in patients with mechanical mitral valves. Given the

patient's prior history of likely cardioembolic stroke, maybe

even higher. Therefore, we would strongly recommend

anticoagulation as soon as deemed safe from neurosurgical

standpoint.



- recommend heparin gtt without bolus, PTT goal 60-80

- may stop aspirin for now

- if stable on heparin, can consider restarting coumadin tomorrow

- will continue to follow



Thank you for this consult. Patient was seen and discussed with

Dr. *****









Addendum by ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** at 5:58 pm:

On the date above, I was present for the key portions of the

history and examination of this patient. I have reviewed and

confirmed the findings and agree with the plan described above. I

would add the following: this patient with mechanical MVR has an

unacceptably high risk for thromboembolic event off of systemic

anticoagulation; thus as soon as safe from neurosurgical

perspective, would heparinize with transition to warfarin. If his

prior CVA was attributable to subtherapeutic INR, then reasonable

to stop ASA in the setting of seeming unprovoked SDH. "

Reason for Consult: agitation, AMS



HPI:

The patient is a ***** with R SDH s/p R craniotomy for SDH

evacuation on *****/*****/*****, as well as a history of T2DM, AFib and

mechanical heart valve originally on Coumadin, discharged *****/***** to

rehab on a heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin with goal INR 2.5-3.5.

He now presents to ***** ***** as transfer from ***** where he was

sent to from his rehab facility for agitation and combativeness

that was refractory to Seroquel/Haldol. ***** Head CT shows R

SDH ~1.0cm in max thickness w/ ~5-6mm midline shift. Prior to d/c

from ***** on *****/*****, he had a ***** Head CT which showed the R

SDH, also ~1.0cm in max thickness w/ ~5-6mm midline shift.



Notably, his ***** is 20mg/dL on ED presentation, which was treated

prior to ***** arrival.



Neurology consulted for help with AMS.



Currently on keppra 1g BID for sz ppx, EEG diffuse slowing R>L

Radiologic Data:



Non-Contrast CT of Head:

IMPRESSION:  

  

Unchanged mixed density subdural hematoma, with the largest

component 

overlying the frontal convexity.  Unchanged 8 mm leftward midline

shift.  No 

new or increasing hemorrhage. 



EEG:

Diffuse slowing R>L, rare epileptic discharges no seizures. 

  



===================

ASSESSMENT: In summary, ***** with R SDH s/p R craniotomy for SDH

evacuation on *****/*****/*****, as well as a history of T2DM, AFib and

mechanical heart valve originally on Coumadin, discharged *****/***** to

rehab on a heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin with goal INR 2.5-3.5.

Stable CT head with R SDH ~1.0cm in max thickness w/ ~5-6mm

midline shift.

EEG with diffuse slowing R>L, rare epileptic discharges no

seizures,



Exam currently only notable for mild inattention otherwise non

focal.





Etiology of his symptoms is most c/w delirium/sundowning given

waxing waning course and agitation most prominent at night. 

There is also a possibility that his keppra contributes to

agitation as this is a known side effect of keppra. It is less

likely that a new vascular insult is the cause of his

intermittent agitation, but given his multiple risk factor we

agree with MRI brain. Would also recommend delirium precautions.

Regarding keppra possibly contributing to his symptoms, since he

did not have any known seizures can consider weaning keppra if

okay from a neurosurgical perspective.



Plan:

- ***** follow up MRI brain

- Delirium precautions (normalize day/night, avoid sedating and 

  anticholinergic medications, encourage family involvement)

- keppra management as above







This case was discussed and seen with Attending Dr. *****

Addendum by ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** at 11:14 am:

I saw ***** ***** ***** ***** at bedside with the neurology team

at 17:35 on *****/*****/***** and have reviewed pertinent labs. In

general, I agree with the assessment and plan as outlined in *****.

*****'s note with the following additions: Mr. ***** is a

pleasant ***** y/o man with recent traumatic subdural s/p craniotomy

who presents from an OSH due to agitation and combative behavior.

Initial head CT negative for interval growth of SDH or new

infarct. Continuous EEG consistent with slowing but no

epileptiform discharges or seizures. Neurology consulted for

evaluation of waxing and waning mental status.



On exam, he is alert and pleasant. He is oriented x 3 but at

times is inattentive. Speech is fluent. Naming is intact. He can

follow both simple and appendicular commands. Pupils equal and

reactive, EOMI full, face symmetric, sensation intact, tongue

midline. Motor exam reveals intact strength, good tone. Sensation

intact to light touch. Mild tremor but no dysmetria with *****.  



In summary, Mr. ***** is a ***** y/o man with recent traumatic SDH

who present with waxing and waning mental status in the setting

for serum glucose fluctuations. Agitation may be multifactorial

from large SDH, metabolic disturbances with delirium. Recommend

delirium precautions. ***** review MRI once completed, although

less concerned about a new infarct or bleed. Keppra may lead to

some agitation and change in mood but defer to NSG regarding

management.

HPI/Subjective Complaint: ***** ***** ***** is a 83 male on

Aspirin 81mg daily with Parkinson's Disease who presents as

transfer from ***** Medical Center s/p ***** with NCHCT

concerning for tiny SDH along the falx versus calcification.

Patient states that he was walking with his dog earlier today

*****/*****/*****, stating ""the dog was walking me"" when he tripped and

fell forward onto his left hip. The patient states that ""it felt

like I was down for 7 hours

outside""; however, per OSH records, likely down for approximately

one hour until his wife found him and called EMS. Patient states

that he tried to call out for help sooner but his wife is deaf

and could not hear him. He was taken to ***** where trauma workup

revealed NCHCT with ""minimal hyperdensity along the midline

cerebral falx which does not definitely represent calcification.

A thin acute subdural hematoma cannot be excluded."" Therefore,

patient was transferred to ***** for neurosurgical evaluation. Pt

with no focal neurologic deficits, no plan for neurosurgical

intervention. Pt presents today for PT initial evaluation to

assess functional mobility and assist with D/C planning.

DIAGNOSIS 

Impairments of Body Functions and Structures, Activity

Limitations and Participation Restrictions 

- Knowledge deficit RE: fall risk, role of PT

- Impaired cognition

- Impaired balance

- Impaired activity tolerance 

- Impaired strength



Clinical Impression/Prognosis: Pt is an ***** with a history of

Parkinson's Disease who presents to physical therapy during

hospitalization s/p ***** with mild TBI. Pt is functioning well

below baseline limited by impairments in body structure and

function including impaired balance, strength, activity

tolerance, and cognition. Pt also presents with activity

limitations in mobility and self-care contributing to difficulty

in fulfilling societal role of home dwelling elder. Patient will

benefit from rehab, recommend D/C to interdisciplinary rehab

setting once medically stable. If plan is for D/C home, pt would

require 24 hour care and assist for all OOB mobility with RW for

safety. Positive prognostic indicators for eventual return home

include pt's prior functioning and motivation to improve.

Limiting factors include pt's ***** and severity of

current deficits. Acute PT will continue to follow and progress

while pt remains in house.



Goals:               Time *****: 2 weeks 

- Pt will perform supine to sit transfer I

- Pt will perform sit to stand transfer with S

- Pt will ambulate 100' with RW and S

Barium swallow was performed demonstrating findings c/w esophageal spasm. LES spasm and disordered upper esoph contractions had been noted on a prior study of *****/*****/*****. EGD demonstrated mild esophagitis, a mild intrinsic stenosis was found 37 to 38 from incisors, and had dilatation performed. - *****-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with  gastrojejunal anastomosis characterized by  healthy appearing mucosa.                    - One non-bleeding jejunal ulcer with no  stigmata of bleeding.  Normal examined jejunum. He was seen in ***** ***** *****. ***** ***** of GI and Dr. ***** ***** of GI motility. He has been followed by them in the past for the same problem and has lost 50 pounds since the *****. He has had esophageal manometry in past consistent with type 3 achalasia (spasm, characterized by rapidly propagated esophageal pressurization attributable to spastic contractions). He had underwent botox injection of the distal esophagus on *****/*****. He was continued on omeprazole and sucralfate during that admission and at that time was tolerating a regular diet without odynophagia or dysphagia. Due to the highly spastic nature pro-motility agents are not likely to be successful, though ***** might improve some ***** symptoms. However, metoclopramide had already been started and the patient was convinced that his swallowing was improving, which was reflected by improved food intake. Diltiazem was added without adverse impact on BP or 
HR, and by the time of discharge he stated that he had no odynophagia or dysphagia and was eating slices of pizza without difficulty. The GI team has recommended peroral endoscopic myotomy (*****) and Dr. ***** ***** of GI Surgery was consulted. He was seen the patient before. Patient s/p *****-en-Y gastric bypass in 2012. He expressed some questions as to whether the data represented classic achalasia or whether his symptoms might arise from a combination of esophagitis, stricture and non-specific dysmotility. In view of his symptomatic improvement he recommended deferring procedure. He was also seen by SLP who concluded that he did not have oropharyngeal swallow problems.     #Necrotic toes:  Plantar tips of both great toes with well marginated dry gangrene. The source of this was not at all clear. Was present for several weeks, painless. Had had extensive evaluation in the past for claudication but did not have evidence of macrovascular peripheral arterial insufficiency. Non-invasive studies were repeated and again found to be normal. Was seen in ***** ***** *****. ***** *****. Has known venous thromboembolic disease and consideration was given to paradoxical emboli (though the rather marked symmetry would suggest against embolic phenomena). There was no other digital involvement. Patient was offered and refused amputation. No other options available and treated locally with ***** here, Bacitracin ointment at home. Echo was done but was not done as a bubble study. Limited views of the IAS did not suggest a shunt. Anticoagulation is not a treatment option in any case due to extensive, previously expanding SDH. Patient has had acute MI and in spite of that no intervention performed then due to absolute contraindication for antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy per neurosurgery consultant. Alternate explanation is paraneoplastic vasculitis    #abnormal EKG:  He has had somewhat variable, fairly profound 
T-wave inversion that seems to have started in ***** of this year and may well be due to the SDH. He has prolonged QT as well. Lateral T-wave inversions can also be seen in esophageal spasm, but the rather abrupt transition to such at the corresponding moment in his medical hx suggests that it is the SDH. He has no overt indication of CAD that I can see. Had a negative perfusion study several years ago (2011). He has no wall motion abnormality on echo.     #Diffuse large B cell lymphoma  S/p ***** *****-***** and ***** cellular therapy infusion on protocol 16-272 (antibody coupled T-cell receptors technically not *****-T per onc, *****/*****). last treated with ***** cellular therapy infusion on protocol 16-272 on ***** *****, *****.

After involved, informed discussions with the patient and his family, ***** was eventually made comfort measures only. ***** died peacefully on *****/*****/***** at 5:08 AM with family surrounding him.  The immediate cause of death was due to his progressive neurologic 
decline from a subdural hematoma.    =================================  HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM  =================================  #Unsteady Gait  #L. Sided Weakness  # R. Subdural Hematoma  Patient developed acute left sided weakness, gait instability, and inability to support himself standing on *****/***** after platelet transfusion. His neuro exam at that time remarkable for extinction to double stimulation on left leg, imbalance while standing, and inability to walk. Had 5/5 strength in all four extremities during seated exam. However, he was unable to lift his feet while standing. The remainder of the neurological exam was unremarkable and his NIHSS was 1. Upon further questioning, patient and wife report having other episodes of left sided weakness and one episode of ***** speech in the past. Imaging revealed mild expansion in the size of his chronic subdural hematoma with more midline shift, which was thought to be the etiology of his symptoms. Brain MRI and CT/CTA Head and Neck did not reveal acute stroke. He was started on keppra and a spot EEG showed theta slowing but no epileptiform discharges. He was transfused to keep his platelets above 50,000 and neurosurgery and neuro-oncology were both consulted. Given the concern that intervention would result in more risk than benefit, the previously suggested middle meningeal artery embolization was deferred and patient was managed with medical management (platelet transfusions). Neuro recommended MRI spine, which revealed a large marrow replacing process in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, concerning for a neoplastic process. Given this in conjugation with limited therapeutic options for the ALL and instability/weakness from progression of the subdural, the family made the decision to pursue hospice care. Palliative care was consulted for assistance with management. Therapeutics were de-escalated and comfort was ***** with IV dilaudid and concentrated 
morphine solution. The patient continued to decline, developing a left facial droop, *****, and hemiplegia.  After involved, informed discussions with the patient and his family, ***** was eventually made comfort measures only. ***** died peacefully on *****/*****/***** at 5:08 AM with family surrounding him.     #CAD s/p CABG  #EKG Changes:   Patient had a history of CABG x3 (***** to mid LAD, SVG to D1 to *****) performed in *****/***** and was noted to have ***** left hemi-diaphragm post-procedurally. On admission, he was noted to have new T wave inversions in V1-V2 with ST segment depressions in septal leads on EKG. Repeat EKG without dynamic changes and posterior EKG without concern for acute ischemia. He had no chest pain and troponins were flat 17-->17. He was continued on home atorvastatin and fractionated metoprolol, which were discontinued when the decision was made to pursue comfort care.      #B-ALL: *****-*****, *****-22 positive. Was treated with ***** chemotherapy, inotuzumab. C/b progressive cytopenia. Most recent bone marrow biopsy *****/***** with 51% blasts. He was continued on prednisone 10mg PO daily and allopurinol, which were discontinued when the decision was made to pursue comfort care.    #Hypercalcemia: Noted to have hypercalcemia on *****/*****/*****. Workup for hypercalcemia of malignancy was sent off. PTH was low at 5. PTHrP was normal. Likely secondary to bone metastasis. He was initially managed with IVF that were discontinued when the decision was made to pursue comfort care.     #Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: diagnosed in ***** ***** with squamous cell lung carcinoma. Previously treated with surgery and *****; has not received systemic therapy. Followed by Dr. *****. He is on 4L O2 at home, which was continued along with his home COPD inhalers and nebulizers.     #Pneumonia: diagnosed with CAP on previous admission, where he had been treated with levofloxacin-->augmentin on discharge. Sputum culture at that 
time growing mixed gram positive and negative organisms; legionella and strep pneumo negative. His augmentin was continued for a total 5 day course.      #Hypothyroidism: He was continued on his home dose of synthroid 175 mcg PO daily (350mcg daily on Wednesdays), which was discontinued when the decision was made to pursue hospice.      #COPD: Lung function tests (*****/*****): FEV1 = 53%, DLCO = 47%. He was continued on his home inhalers.      #Diabetes: Per wife, his outside endocrinologist had taken him off insulin due to lack of appetite and concern for hypoglycemia. Endocrinologist is comfortable with blood sugars <300. On last admission, glucoses were <300. His blood sugars were monitored during his admission and remained <300.    =================================  NOTABLE STUDIES  =================================  CTA Head/Neck (*****/*****/*****):  1.  Since *****/*****/*****, minimally increased right sided subdural collection  measuring up to 1.6 cm in thickness from previously 1.4 cm. There is a trace  amount of acute hemorrhage along the anterior frontal lobe, which is not  significantly changed.     2.  No significant change in small left frontoparietal subdural hematoma with  small foci of acute hemorrhage.     3.  No evidence of interval acute intracranial hemorrhage, acute territorial  infarction or hydrocephalus.    4.  No high-grade stenosis of the major intracranial arteries.     5.  Mild atheromatous narrowing of the right internal carotid artery origin.     =================================  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (FROM H&P)  =================================  ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. male with B-ALL (Ph-; on inotuzumab) and lung cancer (deferring XRT until after leukemia treatment), CAD s/p CABG who presents with unsteady gait.    Patient was recently admitted (*****/*****-*****/*****) for a presumed mechanical ***** while cytopenic during inotuzumab treatment. Imaging at that time revealed small chronic subdural hematoma. He 
had left sided weakness that improved with platelet transfusions and was discharged after clinical improvement. He was noted to have ***** pneumonia and treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin and transitioned to augmentin upon discharge. He and wife denied any other falls that may have explained the chronic nature of the SDH. Neurosurgery was consulted during that admission and had recommended a meningeal artery embolization, which he deferred given his GOC. After shared decision making, patient decided to proceed with platelet transfusions for his subdural hematoma rather than pursuing a more invasive intervention.     The morning of admission, patient and wife report that he was able to walk somewhat normally. They have noticed a gradual decline in his strength recently that they attributed to his steroids and in particular noticed that his left leg seemed weaker. At a routine visit for platelet transfusions the day of admission, he experienced acute gait changes. After finishing the transfusion, patient was noted to be unsteady on his feet with a shuffling gait. He had L>R weakness and was also seen to have left arm weakness as well. The decision was made to admit him for a Head CT and further workup.    During evaluation upon admission, patient was noted to have worsened weakness. He was unable to stand unsupported, falling back towards his left side, and could not lift up his legs while standing. A stroke code was called and patient was taken to ***** ***** ***** and CTA Head/Neck, which showed the stable chronic SDH and no new stroke. Brain MRI was performed, which also did not reveal stroke or worsened SDH. Exam performed by stroke neurology resident notable for extinction to simultaneous touch in the L leg, inability to stand, and L>R difficulty in moving the legs. Neurosurgery was consulted for management of symptomatic subdural hematoma.                 Hospital Care Team   Service: Oncology    Inpatient

PLAN:

- Would recommend tapering ativan; informed that this is planned

(going from ***** to TID) already with a further plan to

discontinue over time.

- Informed that plan is to taper keppra which is already in

motion. Agree with this plan if able to use alternative AEDs as

keppra is generally highest risk in this class of medication for

causing behavioral dysregulation and psychiatric sequelae. 

- For improved sleep and agitation, would recommend seroquel 12.5

mg QID PRN agitation/anxiety, and a continuation of Seroquel 25

mg PO daily and 50 mg PO qHS. 

- Would discontinue trazodone given history of falls and advanced

age in a woman with other risk factors.

- Would obtain daily ECG while on antipsychotic medications

- The patient will not be seen by psychiatry over the weekend

unless an urgent issue arises. In that event, please page *****

for consultation.

Medicine was consulted and assisted in management of 
the patients hyponatremia, Cdiff and *****, the problems are summarized as below.    #Hyponatremia: For his hyponatremia, they felt this was likely SIADH and recommended avoiding salt loads and rechecking sporadically if within GOC, his sodium on day of dispo was 133. He was maintained on 1L fluid restriction.     #CDiff: For his Cdiff, medicine recommended c/w po vanc 125 q6 until *****/***** (inclusive) and they recommended that if he needs antibiosis in the future, would restart PO vanc prophylactically.    #Fever:  In regards to his fever, the patient had a ***** in place since his first hospitalization (placed *****/*****) up until *****/***** ***** when it was removed at his PCP's office. ***** ***** was re-placed in our ED on *****/***** *****. He reported some shaking chills, nausea, and mild abdominal pain while at his SNF, but no frank suprapubic pain, flank pain, or dysuria. Here he had a fever to 100.***** in the ED and has had chills. U/A (obtained as clean catch prior to ***** re-placement) showed 3+ LE and > 100WBC with blood and protein. Urine culture now growing moderate E faecalis which he grew in the same amount on *****/***** when he had no pyuria (also clean catch). Unclear if this picture represents true UTI or more likely that he had inflammation on the U/A from the indwelling catheter/its removal and the E faecalis just represents colonization. His fever could be explained by a variety of other causes including C diff or SDH. He appeared clinically worse on *****/*****, we broadened his empiric antimicrobial coverage to ceftriaxone and IV vancomycin and added IV metronidazole for severe C diff (see below). Since that time his exam has improved and no obvious source of infection other than his CDI has been identified. Therefore we discontinued all empiric therapy and are treating for CDI alone. His foley was discontinued and he is being straight cath'ed. He had a temperature to 100.6 in the evening of *****/*****, this was discussed with medicine and 
given the temp defervesced and the patient had no localizing symptoms, they recommended no further work-up and to move ahead with transition to SNF as within the patients GOC.      #CDI   Diagnosed *****/***** iso recent IV antibiotics for aspiration PNA and predisposition from Crohn's disease/ immunosuppression. Has been on PO vancomycin 125mg QID since that time. During this admission he is still having diarrhea and worse abdominal pain to palpation, thus IV metronidazole was added and CT A/P was obtained to evaluate for complications of C diff. CT A/P showed mild distal colonic thickening and mucosal hyperenhancement, but otherwise unremarkable exam. Given this exam and that he is improving in terms of WBC, decreased frequency of bowel movements, and abdominal examine, we will treat with oral vancomycin alone for 7 days after discontinuing IV antibiotics (*****/*****-*****/*****).    #*****: hold beta blocker and ***** for now. Would reinitiate only if within GOC, and then likely only low-dose beta blocker to avoid hypokalemia.  #palliative care: defer to the consult team, but can consider better nutrition, OOB if possible, relax visitor restrictions, consider low-dose morphine for dyspnea    Palliative care was also consulted at the patient and his family request Per GOC discussion with Palliative Medicine team, patient would not want any surgical or invasive procedure (no feeding tube, no pressors, no ICU), but desires non-invasive imaging and antibiotics for medical management of active issues and in line with this, he was continued on PO Vancomycin for his CDiff infection. He will not follow up with neurosurgery given further interventions would not be in line. A referral will be placed to home based palliative care.     At the families request, the patient was discharged back to the skilled nursing facility he had presented from on *****/*****/*****. He will follow up with his PCP and his family was in agreement.          Medications

Discharge instructions and important events and results    GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  PAIN:  -Pain in the form of headache, may persist for days, to weeks ***** brain injury/bleeding. The headaches will gradually improve, and go away, as the body absorbs the blood on it’s own.   -You may be prescribed a narcotic pain medication to treat this headache. It is very important to only take it as you need it, and wean yourself off, in the days following your discharge.     MEDICATIONS:  -Take your pain medicine as prescribed.   -Continue all other medications you were taking before surgery, unless otherwise directed  -You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post discharge pain or discomfort.  -Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.  -Follow up with your primary care doctor for refills or new prescriptions of you home medications.  -Unless 
directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc, as these can increase the bleeding in your head.      DIET  -Usually no special diet is prescribed after a traumatic brain injury. A normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated, and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may cause constipation.   -You were put on a 1L fluid restriction for his sodium     WHAT ***** ***** ***** *****:  -Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.  -When you go home, you may walk and go up and down stairs. Take your time, and rest if you need to.  -After 1 week, gradually increase your activities and distance walked as you are able to tolerate.      IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:  Regarding Emergencies and After-Hour Calls  -If you have what you feel is a true emergency at any time, please present immediately to your local emergency room, where a doctor there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.

He was also noted to have a cough and ***** at *****. Upon arrival to ***** he had some movements (eyelid fluttering, arm movements) concerning for seizure. He was intubated for airway protection.    Baseline Mental Status: At baseline he is A&***** and conversant even if somewhat slowed in response time.     Notable workup: Imaging studies included CT Head: stable changes from prior without new SDH or worsening *****, EEG showed an array of abnormalities but no evidence of any seizures during LTM, Laboratory studies included workup for toxic/metabolic *****, TSH: 0.06 (fT4=0.9), Na: 139, BUN: 45, Ammonia: 23, Folate: 4.6 (from previous admission, not rechecked), B12: >700 and UA: >100 WBC 
with 3+ ***** from chronic foley. ***** of the VP shunt showed normal glucose and protein, no cells and no growth.   Consultants: Neurology and neurosurgery    Ultimately, the most likely cause of the patient's mental status was felt to be an acute infectious process likely a combination of c diff and UTI (see below). He was able to be extubated, and at the time of discharge was at his baseline mental status per his sister. Notably, there was concern of ongoing seizure activity while in the *****, but ultimately this did not correlate with EEG activity. Mental status improved as patients clinical picture improved. Likely some component of ICU delirium involved as hospital stay increased.    - Continue Keppra 1g BID, pyridoxine  - Continue Sinemet, modafinil  - Outpatient neurology and ***** f/u  - Neurosurgery will arrange follow-up in ***** clinic on *****/***** weeks with CT head prior    #Multiple Infectious etiologies  #Presumed UTI  #C Diff  #Ventilator Associated Pneumonia  Clinical picture most notable for possible infection (WBC >25k; AMS; tachycardia). UA dirty but notably off of a chronic foley. Urine culture grew 50-100k of mixed flora and <10k enterococcus. Blood cx negative. CSF studies without evidence of infection. Chest imaging consistent with possible aspiration on arrival. C diff toxin positive (hx of c diff infection) and increased stool output. No clear consensus about etiology. Patient treated broadly including meningitis coverage on admission. He was also treated with oral vancomycin for C diff. Patient developed increased secretions and respiratory culture grew PsA and burkholderia. Patient's antibiotics course was extended for cefepime for ***** through *****/***** (with c diff prophylaxis). Notably burkholderia was not cefepime resistant, but as patient improved clinically this was not felt to be the likely culprit in the ***** with the PsA also growing which was cefepime sensitive.     - continue oral 
vancomycin for two weeks after cessation of antibiotics (*****/*****)  - c diff prophylaxis with vancomycin if needs antibiotics in the future    #Goals of care  Of note, the patient is now DNR/DNI after ongoing conversations with the family about his goals.     - ***** in the chart     ============================  ============================           Medications   Allergies: Patient has no known allergies.

The most likely cause of this all was an acute infection. We have treated your with antibiotics and your mental status seems to have improved. Because you also have c diff, you should continue taking oral vancomycin for two weeks. To keep building your strength, we are transferring you to ***** Rehab Facility for further care.     Please call your primary care physician or go to an emergency room if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, or you are again having changes in your mental status.     Please see the instructions below for the exact medications that you should take. Please keep all of your scheduled follow up appointments. In the interim, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns.

traumatic L SDH evacuation, who presents to the ED with

continuous aphasia. Neurosurgery was consulted felt pt's

presentation suggestive possibly of seizures or cortical

spreading depression. No progression of the SDH in repeat scan,

recommended neuro consult, increase Keppra and repeat EEG. Neuro

consulted, admitted to neurology to rule out possible stroke,

Other potential etiologies include epileptic aphasia from

frequent or continuous seizure. Pt also found to have possible

UTI, which may cause recrudescence of aphasia from ***** regardless

of any change in size of the SDH. The presence of UTI may also

increase the likelihood of seizures.  EEG shows slowing over left

side, No epileptiform discharges or seizures.

BG 136. At ***** ***** he was not communicative and not following commands, making intermittent eye contact and was moving his LEs. His baseline is being fully oriented. He was given narcan by ***** with no benefit. Pt then had a witnessed generalized seizure in the ED with tonic-clonic activity per chart, which resolved in 2 mins after IV ativan 2mg. He was given IV keppra 3g x1. CT Head revealed left frontal encephalomalacia, no acute findings. Work-up ***** for BMP with Na 136, K 3.5, bicarb 9, Cr 1.4, CBC w Hgb 17.7, Plt 144, UA non-infectious, urine ketones ""small"", utox negative, repeat BMP with bicarb 9, gap 30, Cr 1.4. Repeat BMP with Cr 1.1, bicarb 25. He was transferred to ***** for further care.      Per wife he had no preceding illness or symptoms, has been adherent to his keppra, and had not had seizures since his surgical evacuation. His baseline is independent, oriented and interactive but with minor speech and comprehension difficulties.      Pt follows with Dr. ***** ***** ***** at *****. His keppra was decreased in *****/***** to 1500 qd xr from 2g. In *****/***** clinic visit he was noted to have been taking 1g daily instead of 1500. This was continued, with possible future plan to transition to lamotrigine due to mood complaints.     Hospital Course:     The patient presented after at least two breakthrough generalized tonic clonic seizures.  Following this, he was disoriented with some aphasia for a prolonged period of time.  CT head was negative for acute findings; a workup was negative for infection 
or other metabolic or toxic factors that would be considered to have lowered the seizure threshold. He had not missed any doses of Keppra, per wife. For this reason, his current dose was felt to be inadequate for seizure prevention, and was increased from 1000mg daily to 750mg BID.  Additionally, lamotrigine was started at a dose of 25mg daily, with the intention to increase per schedule, as had been discussed previously by his epileptologist, Dr. ***** ***** *****.

You have epilepsy due to your traumatic brain injury.  We believe that the dose of your anti-seizure medication, Keppra (levetiracetam) needs to be higher to prevent you from having more seizures in the future.  We have increased the dose of your Keppra to 750mg twice daily.  Your epilepsy doctor, Dr. ***** ***** *****, is in agreement with this plan.    We understand that Keppra has unfortunately had some negative effects on your mood.  Together with Dr. *****, we plan to transition you to another medication, Lamictal (lamotrigine), that will have a more positive effect on your mood.      ***** lamotrigine uptitration by the dosage and frequency as outlined below.

Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.     ACTIVITY:  The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again. In general:  -Follow the activity 
instructions given to you by your doctor and therapist.  -Increase your activity slowly.  -You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.  -If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.  -Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your physician.  -Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.  -Do your breathing exercises every two hours.    -Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour that you are awake.      WHEN TO CALL YOUR SURGEON:  With any surgery there are risks of complications. Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing. These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes. Call your Physician Immediately if you Experience:  -Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.  -*****, or blurred vision. Loss of vision, either partial or total.  -Hallucinations  -Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.  -***** neck, and/or a fever of 101.***** or more.  -Severe sensitivity to light. (Photophobia)  -Severe headache or change in headache.  -Seizure  -Problems controlling your bowels or bladder.  -Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.  -Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.  Important Instructions Regarding Emergencies and After-Hour Calls If you have what you feel is a true emergency at any time, please present immediately to your local emergency room, where a doctor there will evaluate you and contact us if needed. Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.

He was diagnosed with Meningo-encephalitis and a right thigh hematoma and later got ***** at ***** and thereafter had a skilled nursing facility.      By time he arrived to the ED, a CT scan of his head revealed a small right paraclinoid intracerebral hemorrhage without mass-effect or midline shift and a CT angiogram of his head and neck did not reveal any aneurysm or signs of active vascular hemorrhage.  A Lyme screen came back negative and also he is on blood thinners, patient had not used his p.m. dose of Eliquis.  He has no new focal neurological deficits at the moment is now being admitted for further observation.     Subdural hematoma: Head CT shows a right paraclinoid intracranial hemorrhage without mass-effect or midline shift. Discussed case with Dr. ***** from general surgery who recommended admission to the medical service with close monitoring.  Repeat ***** ***** this morning showed no interval worsening but did show redistribution of previously described bleed.

RE:  ***** ***** (*****-*****-*****)  DOB:  *****/*****/*****



Dear Dr. *****,



I saw *****. ***** for her pacemaker check.



As you know, she has:

1.  Syncope due to sick sinus syndrome .

2.  Subdural hematoma secondary to syncope.

3.  Status post DDD pacemaker (***** *****).

4.  Coronary artery disease status post IMI, (*****/*****)

5.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.



As you know, Mrs. ***** was admitted to ***** ***** in *****

2018 following syncope and ***** during which she hit her head and

sustained a subdural hematoma.  At that time, there was a

question of whether she had an acute inferior myocardial infarct

as well and underwent cardiac catheterization during which she

did have coronary artery disease and significant stenosis of the

right coronary artery.  However, the vessel was not stented

because of ***** her in the presence of her subdural

hematoma.  She had a pacemaker implanted before discharge and

again because of her subdural hematoma.  Her atrial fibrillation

onset dates back to 2009.



Since her discharge, she has had weakness from her right leg 

resulting in difficulty in walking.



I note that her most recent ***** scan shows that her subdural

hematoma has resolved and she is due to see Dr. ***** from

Neurosurgery in followup to be cleared.



She denied any chest pain, undue shortness of breath, recurrent

syncope, palpitations, swelling of her ankles or nocturnal

dyspnea.



Review of other systems negative.



Her present medications are alendronate 70 mg weekly, furosemide

20 mg daily, Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis, levetiracetam 100

mg/mL 7.5 mL daily, lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, methotrexate 25 mg

weekly, metoprolol ER 50 mg daily, rosuvastatin 40 mg daily,

aspirin 81 mg daily.



Examination today revealed her to be generally well, comfortable,

alert, oriented, not short of breath at rest.



Her venous pressure was not elevated.  Carotids were normal. 

Thyroid was not palpable.  Rest of the head and neck exam was

unremarkable.



Her cardiac exam revealed a slightly irregular rhythm.  Venous

pressure, normal heart sounds, no significant murmurs.  No S3 and

no edema.



Her lungs were clear.



Abdomen was soft and benign.



Neurological examination was grossly normal.



Pacemaker was checked today.  She has a ***** Scientific, model

Accolade, MRI-compatible pacemaker implanted on ***** *****, *****. 

She has had significant episodes of atrial fibrillation since as

per her pacemaker.  The pacemaker is programmed to DDD and has at

least 11.5 years of remaining battery longevity.  Today, she was

in atrial flutter with P waves of 4.5 ***** and normal

atrial lead impedance.  The right ventricular lead revealed R

waves of 11 *****, pacing threshold 1.4 volts at 0.4

millisecond pulse width, impedance 852 ohms and her atrial

fibrillation burden is 87%.



Given the high burden of atrial fibrillation and the fact that

her subdural hematoma has resolved and she has had no further

episodes of syncope, I will start her on Xarelto 20 mg daily.



At some point in the future, we may need to revaluate her cardiac

catheterization to see if she needs an intervention, which was

initially postponed because of the danger of using

anticoagulants.



I plan to see her in four months for a pacemaker check.



With kind regards,



Sincerely yours,

Reason for consult: meningitis coverage with PCN allergy



CHIEF COMPLAINT / HPI OBTAINED FROM:  

{}Patient {}Family/Friend {}Interpreter {X}Other: Medical records



Patient unresponsive



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  meningitis



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  

***** yo F with hx of DM, HTN, recent SDH,  Afib not on AC, also

with recent admit for coccygeal osteomyelitis, who presents with

unresponsiveness and reported seizure activity.



Of note in ***** she was admitted with fever after being found

down, no focal source of infection found at that time. Rehab

notes afterwards noted multiple chronic wounds and diabetic

ulcers including buttock, ischium. followed at ***** ***** wound

care clinic, worsening, with purulent *****, which led to the

***** admission and abx course as below.



She was recently again admitted in ***** for for deep sacral

ulcer non-healing since ***** in *****, and more recently in

***** w/ clinical, imaging and laboratory evidence all

suggestive of mixed deep infection with associated coccygeal

osteomyelitis. Bedside debridement x2 (*****/*****, *****/*****) by ACS. Pt

refused coccygeal bx, so she was treated broadly with antibiotics

(*****/ertapenem) with start date *****/*****/***** with planned end date

*****/*****. At that time, MRI showed some enhancement c/f coccygeal

osteo with associated ***** from ulcer extending towards

coccyx. Swab from *****/***** grew mixed flora and MSSA (pan S) and

that is all the micro we have.



She was now admitted *****/***** after being found unresponsive.

Apparently she had some loose stool over the past week with

vomiting x1 a week ago. She became confused day of admission and

then unresponsive and brought to ED. Apparently she was afebrile

at rehab in this context; ***** witnessed what seemed to be a tonic

clonic seizure. In ED received Ativan, keppra, head CT without

bleed or infarct. ***** 120s, trialed on BIPAP (DNR) but HR and BP

dropped profoundly, improved w/ fluids however. CTA head and neck

did not show large clots. CXR without clear PNA.



Initially she was covered with vanc/CTX/acyclovir, but given h/o

sacral osteo, changed *****/***** to meropenem, vanc, acyclovir (listed

as allergy to ampicillin).



Here labs initially with WBC 10, 9 this morning. Noted to have

anemia. Plts normal. Creatinine 0.8, LFTs largely reassuring. She

does have mildly elevated troponins. Serum tox screen neg. UA

reassuring. LP was done with WBC (7 tube 1, 5 tube 5), RBC (219,

123), pmn (55%, 51%), Lymph (29%, 32%). Total protein 50, glucose

116. 1+ PMNs. 



At the time of this interview she was unresponsive to verbal and

physical stimuli. ROS unable to be obtained.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA:  NGTD blood and CSF cultures



IMAGING DATA:

CTA head/neck:

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: 

No acute intracranial abnormality. 

  

CTA HEAD: 

The vessels of the circle of ***** and their principal

intracranial branches 

are patent without stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.

The dural 

venous sinuses are patent. 

  

CTA NECK: 

The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are

patent. 

  

OTHER: 

Mucous/secretions in the oropharynx and trachea, causing greater

than 50% 

occlusion of the tracheal lumen area (4:66).



CXR

 

IMPRESSION:  

  

Patient rotated to the right.  Right PICC terminates in the

proximal right atrium without evidence of pneumothorax. 

Difficult to exclude small right pleural effusion. 

  

ASSESSMENT: 

***** yo F with hx of DM, HTN, recent SDH,  Afib not on AC, also

with recent admit for coccygeal osteomyelitis, who presents with

unresponsiveness and reported seizure activity.



Her LP results are not consistent with a bacterial meningitis

(essentially normal WBC count of only 5, with reassuring

protein/glucose and PMN count. She has almost completed the

course for her sacral osteo, so given concerns about antibiotics

lowering the seizure threshold, and nothing on LP to support

bacterial meningitis, would discontinue antibiotics at this

point. However, would send CSF HSV PCR and continue IV acyclovir

until this has resulted negative. It's not clear that another

infection is responsible for her current presentation either; UA

and CXR are reassuring, and she has been afebrile, though await

blood culture results which are pending. 



We will continue to follow.



RECOMMENDATIONS: 

- discontinue meropenem/vancomycin

- continue IV acyclovir, add on CSF HSV PCR, and can DC acyclovir

if this results negative

after ***** with *****, found to have mixed density R SDH and R SAH (non-operative).   The patient was admitted to the ***** with a traumatic right SDH and right SAH secondary to a witnessed mechanical ***** with *****. On admission the patient had no neurologic deficits noted on his exam. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended a non-operative treatment course. The SDH/SAH were stable on interval scan *****/***** 9 am. He was continued on Keppra 500 mg BID for anticipated 7d course (*****/*****-*****/*****). Home aspirin was held, with plan to resume in about 4 weeks after new f/u head CT and Neurosurgery evaluation in clinic. The patient remained stable upon transfer to Neurology floor on *****/*****, with a non-focal exam. PT recommended home with home PT.     Regarding cause of the *****, the history was most concerning for orthostatic syncope in the setting of hypotension with antihypertensive, cardiac (arrhythmia, given bradycardia), mechanical *****. Less likely vasovagal with no preceding symptoms,. Had a negative CT-PE. Low suspicion for seizure with no tongue biting or loss of bowel/bladder control. No evidence of peripheral neuropathy in feet on exam. He had a routine EEG (only 20 minute study) without epileptiform discharges; this was considered sufficient given very low suspicion for seizure. He had no carotid bruits on exam. TTE showed LVEF 50% with segmental wall motion abnormalities (anterior akinesis and apical hypokinesis), with left atrial dilation, right atrial dilation, and RV dilation. Per Care Everywhere, last TTE was *****/***** with LVEF 55% without mention of wall motion abnormalities. D Dimer was elevated to 1623. Workup for bradycardia showed Lyme serology negative, TSH wnl. He had initial orthostatics *****/***** that were negative by HR (rise of 16 bpm) and SBP (***** ***** ***** mmHg) without symptoms. However in the setting of further blood pressure control with resuming home isordil he was found to have SBP drop from 
101 sitting to 84 standing with HR 70 to 88. Home blood pressure medications were adjusted: isordil was discontinued (was on for angina), captopril 12.5 mg TID was continued, and low-dose metoprolol 6.25 mg Q6H was re-introduced. His blood pressures and orthostatic VS improved on this regimen.    Besides the ***** and traumatic SDH, Mr. ***** the patient had addressed the following medical issues:    Pulmonary fibrosis. The patient was found to have evidence of pulmonary fibrosis on CXR but did not have a known prior diagnosis of this. He was breathing well on RA during admission. He had a high-resolution CT chest that showed severe emphysematous changes in the lungs bilaterally and changes most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.     CAD s/p PCI, TTE with new WMAs: TTE showed stable LVEF 50% but new segmental WMAs including anterior akinesis and apical hypokinesis, and *****-atrial dilation and RV dilation, which were not seen previously. These new findings were communicated to his outpatient cardiologist Dr. ***** *****, who planned to follow-up with the patient after discharge for consideration of possible repeat stress and catheterization when safe from a neurology perspective.      Weight loss. Patient presented with recent 20 pound weight loss, concerning for possible malignancy or malnutrition. Malnutrition is favored given also slightly prolonged INR on admission (1.3) which resolved after administration of vitamin K. TSH was WNL as above. Nutrition recommended high-protein diet and Ensure Plus daily. Vit D was low at 12 and he was started on supplementation.       Macrocytic anemia. He was noted to have a mild macrocytic anemia on admission, with Hgb 11.3 and MCV 100.3. He was also thrombocytopenic to 135 and later was also leukopenic. He was iron replete (***** 30%), with normal B12 and folate. SPEP and serum free light chains were notable for elevated IgG (1509, ULN 1295) and IgA (894, ULN 309) with normal 
IgM; pattern was pending at time of discharge. ***** notable for elevated free K:L ratio of 2.16 (ULN 1.70). Given his cytopenias there was clinical concern for multiple myeloma. Pending SPEP pattern, skeletal survey and bone marrow biopsy should be considered in follow up.    The patient was recommended to schedule a rapid visit with his PCP and cardiologist.

Neurology Resident ***** ***** *****/*****



Reason for Consultation:



HPI: ***** ***** is a ***** year old male with a history of alcohol

use disorder and withdrawal seizures as well as necrotizing

alcohol induced pancreatitis, and IDDM who was ***** *****/*****/*****

and subsequently developed headache found to have SDH now s/p 3

SDH *****, currently with subdural drain in place on

Keppra, who was consulted for medication recommendations after a

possible complex partial seizure last night.



History elicited from chart review. The patient initially

presented after an assault on *****/*****/***** where he was found to have

a facial and nasal fracture and was *****. No surgery was

indicated at this time. Patient was discharged home and was told

not to do heavy lifting. A few weeks later he started having a

headache, and reported he had returned to work as a roofer, and

had been doing heavy lifting during this time. 



On *****/***** he presented to OSH with 1 week h/o worsening headache

where CTH showed large left SDH. He was taken to *****, had the SDH

evacuated and subdural drain was placed, removed two days later.

Patient was discharged on *****/***** on Keppra 1g PO BID. The patient

went home, then represented to OSH on *****/***** with worsening

headache, where NCHCT showed left SDH with more midline shift. He

was ***** to ***** for further management.



Patient was taken to ***** on *****/*****, had SDH evacuated again on *****/*****

with subdural drain placed, which was then removed on *****/*****. On

*****/*****, the patient reportedly had a ***** for 30 seconds for which

his Keppra was increased to 1500mg BID. On *****/***** the patient had

to be code purple due to agitation and and attempt to leave the

hospital. A repeat CTH for agitation was ordered, which showed a

recurrence of the left SDH with worsening midline shift. On *****/*****

the patient was taken back to the OR and had another SDH

evacuation, and the subdural drain is currently in place. 



The patient supposedly had a complex partial seizure last night,

for which neurology was consulted in order to determine which

second agent should be added in the face of a new possible

seizure disorder.



On neurologic review of systems, the patient endorses headache.

Denies lightheadedness, difficulty with producing or

comprehending speech. Denies blurred vision, diplopia, tinnitus,

dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies focal muscle weakness, numbness,

parasthesia. 



On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or

chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies

cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,

palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or

abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

IMAGING:

 Non-Contrast CT of Head:

 

IMPRESSION:  

  

1.  No significant change in fluid collections, including

components of acute 

subdural hemorrhage.  Minimal left uncal herniation is stable. 

2.  Stable 6 mm rightward midline shift. 

3.  No new hemorrhage is identified. 





ASSESSMENT:

***** ***** is a ***** year old male with a history of alcohol use

disorder and withdrawal seizures as well as necrotizing alcohol

induced pancreatitis, and IDDM who was ***** *****/*****/***** and

subsequently developed headache found to have SDH now s/p 3 SDH

*****, currently with subdural drain in place on Keppra,

who was consulted for medication recommendations after a possible

complex partial seizure last night.

Neurological exam is significant for mental status oriented to

self and hospital only with fluctuation (agitation with code

***** today followed by period where he became ""aphasic"" and

not answering questions to primary team), some inattention and

potentially refusal to participate in exam, as well as

symmetrically increased reflexes in the lower extremities with

prominent withdrawal so unable to assess plantar response. CTH

this afternoon for continued fluctuation in mental status showed

no change from prior. 

An event overnight was called a complex partial seizure, but no

further description of the event is available. Differential for

mental status that fluctuates between agitation and A/*****-3

includes delirium vs non-convulsive status vs toxic-metabolic

effect. Clinically, he appears to appear delirious, as he will

follow commands and answer some questions in between periods of

agitation but remains confused and not fully oriented or able to

provide history. However, he does have structural brain damage

with fluctuating ICP given repeated drains and *****, so he is

at high risk for an epileptic focus. 



Recommendations:

- Trial of Ativan when agitated/not following commands to see if

he has symptomatic improvement. Would give 2mg of Ativan and

assess response. 

- cvEEG monitoring to rule out non-convulsive status

- Would recommend holding off on loading second AED at this point

given lack of clear description of seizure episode overnight.

However, if he cannot get EEG and continues to have AMS, Dilantin

would likely be first choice. 

- Recommend full toxic metabolic workup be repeated, including

LFTs and lipase. 

- West consult team to follow.

He tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home on *****/*****/*****.      He saw Dr. ***** in clinic today who noted that the patient has been having N/V x2 days with progressive motion induced vertigo. He underwent a head CT which 
was stable from prior. He was admitted to the neurology floor to exclude any central source and evaluate for sources of his symptoms. On medication review with his family, it was noted that they had been administering lacosamide 400mg BID (instead of 200mg BID), and -as a result- poison control was contacted who recommended holding the medication and checking a level. Continuous cardiac monitoring was started to ensure there was no evidence of arrythmias or bradycardia.    - Notable Admission Imaging -  Head CT (*****/*****/*****): Evolving postsurgical changes overlying the left frontoparietal regions with no evidence of superimposed acute pathology.

Work-up for his current presentation of acute decline revealed: head CT with subdural fluid collection that appeared slightly decreased in size in comparison to the prior CT, postsurgical changes with interval resorption of pneumocephalus, unchanged rightward midline shift, no evidence of uncal herniation, no evidence of new hemorrhage or infarct. Delirium work-up revealed hypercalcemia (see below), while polypharmacy was concerning for a contributing cause. Of note, he had no focal or asymmetric neurological deficits on exam, VBG was within normal limits, and TSH elevated 6.55, Free T4 WNL. Infectious 
work-up with urinalysis and chest X-ray were normal. In the setting of tapering off keppra (as below), patient underwent EEG which showed some diffuse theta/delta slowing of the background, no epileptiform abnormalities seen. Pt was also treated with an aggressive bowel regimen. In consultation with patient's outpatient endocrinologist, his lantus was dose reduced and switched to the morning with good effect.  Psychiatry was consulted, and in consultation with patient's outpatient psychiatrist Dr. *****, memantine, modafinil, and bupropion were stopped.  His PO risperidone was changed to 0.25mg Q8H PRN with melatonin ***** ***** After doing the above interventions, patient showed significant improvement in his mental status back to normal. In discussion with patient's family, the decision was made to discharge the patient home with hospice care at home as well as 24 hr personal care. Patient and family reported he wishes to be DNR/DNI and do not hospitalize. At discharge, patient was counseled to use the risperidone only sparingly for agitation not responding to verbal redirection.     #Mild hypercalcemia: On admission, Ca 11.3, iCa 1.40. His EKG was at his baseline notable for ECG w/ known RBBB and wide QRS, 1st degree AV block, unchanged from prior.  Thought not to be secondary to secondary hyperthyroidism as PTH in the 80s. On ddx include multiple myeloma, oncogenic hypercalcemia, or immobilization hypercalcemia. SPEP was normal pattern, ***** WNL, 25OH vitamin D 59. Patient received IV fluids and pamidronate x 2, and was continued on cinacalcet. At discharge, his Ca was 9.6 WNL.  - Pending labs: PTHrP, 1,25 ***** Vit D  - consider parathyroid scan as outpatient if work up unrevealing     #L Subdural hemorrhage: Reportedly chronic, identified when patient presented with mild speech and gait changes as well as confusion earlier this *****. ***** 3.5 cm with 1 cm midline shift.

improvement in neurological symptoms. Subsequent CT scans have shown slow improvement, most recently with 19 mm thickness and residual midline shift on *****/*****. Keppra wean was continued as planned, and he completed his last dose on *****/*****.  - Outpatient ***** follow up      #Kidney transplant: ***** in 2008, c/b renal artery stenosis and HTN. On prednisone/tacrolimus for immunosuppression. Bactrim stopped during recent hospitalization due to AKI. Transplant Nephrology was following, and additionally provided recommendations for management of his hypercalcemia as noted above. Pt was continued on Tacrolimus 1mg PO BID.     #Mild cognitive impairment: MoCA *****/***** in *****/*****. At baseline: fully oriented, can do basic calculations, intact attention, memory w/ mild impairments (*****/***** recall at 5 minutes). Motor exam with a little bit of generalized weakness throughout, at least *****/***** without focal deficits. Eats w/ assistance. Ambulatory w/ a rolling walker, with two-person assist. As noted for management of altered mental status above, memantine was stopped while risperidone was dose adjusted to PRN.  - Consider outpatient follow-up for consideration of cognitive rehabilitation therapy    #T2DM: he was on 25 lantus QAM, lispro 5 TID at *****. This was dose reduced to 10 lantus QAM (5 if NPO), and the standing lispro was discontinued following recommendation from his Endocrinology. He required minimal lispro sliding scale of usually 1U with meals.   - Resume home ***** at 10U daily      #HTN: HFpEF and renal artery stenosis. Recently stopped HCTZ given the hypercalcemia, uptitrated to amlodipine 10 daily, lasix 40 daily, coreg 50 BID which were continued.      #Aortic stenosis with HFpEF: moderate AS, mean gradient 37 mmHg, valve area <1cm2.      #Depression: Follows with Dr. *****. Noted to have MoCA *****/***** in *****/*****. Bupropion was discontinued, while duloxetine was continued for management of altered mental status as noted 
above.    #Chronic pain: Has been on opioids for many years. Stopped prior to his presentation from ***** in reaction to altered mental status.

The patient initially presented in early ***** with mild speech and gait changes, intermittent mild confusion with waxing and waning mental status, found to have large chronic L SDH, max thickness 3.5 cm with 1 cm midline shift. ***** hole evacuation of L-sided SDH on *****/*****, started on keppra 500 bid for seizure prophylaxis.      On returning home, had low-grade temps and was admitted on *****/***** due to concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. 7-day course vanc/levaquin. Course c/b flash pulmonary edema requiring ICU transfer, bumex gtt, and high-flow NC. Weaned to RA at discharge. Course notable for peak Cr 3.09 and cessation of home ACEi and bactrim, to be restarted outpatient. Also had decreased mental status on admission and slow response to questioning. EEG w/o seizure activity, head CT stable, continued on keppra ppx for SDH. Per neurosurgery, patient was to continue keppra until *****/*****.      Admitted to ***** on *****/*****, where he was receiving PT and OT. However, per his wife and daughter, he was not at his baseline even when he went to *****. He could engage only minimally with therapy and would frequently ***** asleep during rehab. Was still alert and 
oriented x3, but eating and drinking progressively less. They felt his last good day was Tuesday, 3 days prior to presentation. After that he began complaining of worsening double vision and difficulty seeing what others could see. He was more agitated and in the 24 hours prior to presentation, developed very bad headaches that left him crying and rocking back and forth.      Initially, AMS thought to be due to keppra. ***** conferred with Dr. ***** and Dr. ***** ***** and initiated an expedited keppra taper. He is now on 250 qday with last dose on *****/*****. Psychiatric meds were continued as is: wellbutrin 150 daily, duloxetine 60 daily, memantine 5 BID, and modafinil 200 daily. Risperidone was decreased on *****/***** from 0.25 BID to 0.25 QHS. For hypercalcemia with iCa 1.52, he was started on sensipar 30 mg daily and mIVF. HCTZ for HTN was stopped and amlodipine titrated to 10 instead.      CT on *****/*****: residual 19 mm left cerebral convexity heterogeneous, but predominantly hypodense, subdural fluid collection appears slightly decreased in size in comparison to the prior CT. Postsurgical changes with interval resorption of pneumocephalus. Unchanged rightward midline shift. No evidence of uncal herniation. No evidence of new hemorrhage or infarct.     Due to acute worsening on *****/*****, the patient was transferred to ***** for additional work up.
